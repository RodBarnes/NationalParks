            "transcript": "Hi folks and friends. I'm JP Anderson, park ranger here at Indiana Dunes National Park, and today we're out at Kemil Beach and there's a really neat trail out here, the Dune Ridge Trail and that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna take a quick little hike on this trail today. I'll point out a few interesting things along the way. It's springtime, a great, great place. I'll show you one of my favorite spots. Also all of these trails are online, so we'll put a link on there to show you where you can get all detailed maps. Come with me. Let's go. All right. Well, I wanted to briefly explain dune succession. It's something we talk about in the dunes, especially with a lot of the school children and such. Basically what it is, is how dunes, the environment changes over time and, really, that's with soil. So you'll have in the beginning just a bare sandy soil, let's say. And then through time you'll get some pioneer plants that start to grow in there they don't need a lot of nutrients and a lot of soil moisture, but they grow. They're very hardy plants. Like a pioneer plant would be, like, a marram grass or a cottonwood tree. Okay, very hardy, resilient plants. What happens is they grow for a while , and then in this really, really just sandy soil , their leaves and leaf litter and debris, and such eventually turns into a little richer soil. It has the capability of holding the moisture a little more, and it has more nutrients in it. So, what happens is then more plants can grow. And it's just that simple: with more plants then you get a richer soil, and you eventually get a more diverse habitat with many or many more plants that can grow in it. And then with that you get more and more animals as well. So, that's kind of dune succession in a nutshell. Here's a really neat pioneer plant, wormwood, right here, and it's the second year here with the seeds. So, the first year kind of looks like this, really soft, and the second year you have the seed head there. I also wanted to remind everyone just about the phenomenal birding in the region here. We're on a major migratory flyway, and for instance, probably real soon this week I'm probably gonna come out here and sit in the parking lot and just look right here on this little dune, this dune area. They'll probably be some woodcocks out here doing their incredible little flying mating thing right here. It's really something to see. So the woodcocks, look that up. It's something interesting. So many wonderful things going on in this park all around us. All right. Basically what we've just done: we come off of the parking lotand we've gone through that little foredune area that I stopped at and talked about dune succession a little bit. You'll come over this dune ridge and then all at once you're in a nice little oak forest here. And you'll see this, we put this in here years ago for doing environmental education programs, but, golly, I've seen groups out here. I've seen church groups out here, youth groups out here, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts. I mean, hey, have a picnic out here, come on out, and have some fun. We have a lot of old home sites before this park was established. A lot of the land had already been purchased and there were homes, and a lot of those homes have been taken down. So, you'll even see that some plants that maybe shouldn't be here, like some yucca here and such, but we do home site restorations and things like that too. That's a whole 'nother ballgame, but we're gonna basically just continue on our walk right here. Just so that you can keep your bearings. Just off of where that little amphitheater area was there was an old road here. I was saying, used to be roads here and homes, but here's an old road coming off of Kemil. But you'll see the DR for Dune Ridge, so we just kind of follow it right up towards that dune ridge. A couple things you may notice along the trail are some trees that kind of are, just almost, like snaky. Call 'em snaky sassafras is what I call them with the kids. It's a sassafras tree. They're very fragrant, yeah, you scrape 'em off a little bit, then you can smell this. Smell really, really citrusy, almost, to me, and it's a neat tree. And when they-- when they leaf out, they'll actually have three different shaped leaves: one that's kind of just one lobe, like a football, and one kind of like a mitten, and one kind of has three lobes, put two holes in it, looks like a ghost. But you also see trees that look as though they've been burned and they have been. We do have management prescribed burns here too to work with this area and keep it the way we like it. And with the different oaks in here, and then you have the understory like the sassafras as well. Neat story about that, we had a group here a couple summers back and there's a lot of wildlife here too. And one of the people said, \"Hey look Ranger there's a, there's a rabbit right there,\" and it was right here. And I looked over and I go, \"I'll be darned,\" and here comes this big Eastern Box Turtle. Was kind of just walking towards us I kind of got a kick out of that. That was fun, but just to tell you what kind of different animals are out here. Box turtle would be quite a treat. We just passed some folks, and they said there was a bald eagle down here on a tree towards the marsh area, so I'm gonna, hopefully we'll get a look at it. I mentioned the management prescribed burns, and here's a good example of a burn. You'll see a lot of the burned trees around the area, but you also see an open area here too. Why we do that is for many, many years, traditionally there were fires that came through naturally and then people just put fires out. That's what people do. Well, it wasn't, it wasn't the natural process, so we're kind of getting back to that natural process. And then it helps with controlling the invasives and things like that as well. So, just wanted to share that. Another wonderful part of this trail is when you come over through the woods here and over this dune, you get this beautiful view of the remnant of the Great Marsh area here. Great habitat for migratory birds that are coming for a nice resting area, some food. An abundance of wildlife lives out there as in any wetland, and okay, I hear some of my friends. I want to go down and see some of these frogs. Spring time. Great time for listening to the wildlife out here, especially in the marsh area. I hear some spring peepers and some chorus frogs. Little wetlands, like this little wetland area, is the perfect place where they mate, they lay their eggs. There's a lot of food sources in there too, a little macro invertebrate and such. And I'll hike up here and show you my favorite part of the whole entire trail. From the low area down here by the Great Marsh, this is probably the steepest incline you're gonna have going up the backside of this dune ridge here, but the view's way worth it. Okay, what we're about halfway there. We're gonna head up to that point right there. Now you're here, this is one of my favorite parts in the whole entire park. I've been a ranger here for 30-some years, and this is one of the best views I've found. This Great Marsh-- I can just imagine sometimes how much it went on, how large it was. The abundance of wildlife that depended on it but still does today. That's why we have national parks. To save and protect for our future generations to have views like this, but also mainly for the plants and animals that depend on these areas for their survival. Wow, come out here and hike this trail. See this view. It's quite spectacular. Another great advantage of hiking this trail in the spring is you can actually get a glimpse of Lake Michigan, a beautiful huge dune ridge right off of its shores out here. Golly, that is just beautiful. Well, we just saw that spectacular view, one of my favorite parts in the whole entire park. And now right around the bend, look. I'm gonna descend down into these mighty oaks. All right. Well, we were talking about dune succession and how habitats changed through time has a lot to do with the soil. So, I just wanted to, saw a really good example here of a soil horizon, and right down in here, and what's really nice is as the changing-- as it changes with the leaf litter and the decomposition and such, the soil gets to the point where it can hold moisture a little better. And it also has a lot more nutrients in it and the soil temperature, which allows more diversity, more plants to grow here, which then you have more animals coming into the area. That's just kind of a little part of that dune succession how habitats change here in the dunes through time. Well I've had a blast hiking the Dune Ridge Trail with everyone. I hope you enjoyed it too. Please, please keep in mind stay on the trail the best you can, poison ivy, a lot of ticks. Ticks are bad, real bad. All ready in the spring, we've been finding ticks out here, but nonetheless it's not a reason to not come out to hike. S,o find your park. Mine is this park. Find your spot, mine's this spot, you saw it, I showed you my secret little spot. I love it. There's many more in this park. So, anyways hope you enjoyed it. Come out and hike the dunes. Hey, one more thing: if you enjoyed this virtual hike and you get a chance to come out, take some photos and post them, post them on the comments on our site. We'd like to see them. Thanks.",

So Rachel, one of the reasons that we're here tonight is that independence National Historical Park took the somewhat unusual step of actually photographing this graffiti and then posting it on social media. Could you tell us about the National Park Service's existing policies around monuments and vandalism, and then explain the new proposals that encourage documentation of graffiti and other forms of vandalism and why this might be important. [Rachel Adler appears in the inset on the screen featuring six examples of graffiti on stones and the back of a sign.] RACHEL ADLER: Sure. Thank you so much. Thanks for inviting me to be a part of this really important conversation, sometimes a very difficult conversation. So as Dr. Silverman mentioned, I'm going to change gears a little bit and talk not about this monument specifically, a bit about graffiti and the National Park Service. So what you're looking at here is a variety of graffiti from Western Parks which are mostly the parks that I work on. And I just wanted to underscore that graffiti is an issue that all National Park units deal with, it's not just urban parks, and it's not just during times of social unrest.

On one, black paint spells out \"Y'all not tired yet?\" On another black paint spells out \"ACA BLM\" and \"END White silence.\" A third shows black and white paint some of which reads \"ACAB\" and {expletive \"F\"} 12. Finally, there is a photo of the Stuart County Standard newspaper with a headline reading, \"Ignorance leads to desecration of mass grave marker.\"] These are all examples of graffiti using various materials on different materials, different types of stone, and on different resources. So we have graffiti on natural resources on cultural resources, and on facilities on bathrooms and on the signs that you see when you go to National Parks. So these are all issues that are dealt with by national park staff, different divisions depending on what the graffiti effects. But it's a pervasive issue that's faced by that's faced across the country. And because the graffiti on the tomb the Unknown Revolutionary War soldier was related to the protests of the summer of 2020. I'm going to talk a little bit about that. So, after the protests and during actually the protests in the summer of 2020, National Park Service staff was asked to give a virtual training on how to remove graffiti because so many parks and private entities were dealing with that issue and sometimes they were on structures of great cultural and historical importance, and depending on the structure and on the surface, graffiti removal can be actually really complicated. So the focus of that training was actually removal techniques and materials and there was some documentation-- some discussion of documentation but it was primarily focused on documentation for crime scene investigation because of course graffiti is vandalism and vandalism is a crime. And also to collect evidence to either help find perpetrators of the vandalism or for use during prosecution. Despite the fact that the training was in response to graffiti that was obviously connected with the protests and the social unrest. Aspects of removal and documentation weren't handled any differently than they would have been for any other type of vandalism. So a teenager tagging a monument with his name is not going to be handled any differently from graffiti that is obviously connected to social issues and issues of racial justice. This led to discussions around whether we as Park Service employees had a responsibility beyond just being subject matter experts on materials conservation to address the larger societal issues that the graffiti was obviously representing. As National Park Service employees, we are charged with carrying out our individual or tasks individual tasks that are related to our specific fields of study, but we're also stewards of sites of historic importance that are meant to tell the stories of all Americans, and that includes Americans today who sometimes have a really complicated relationship with the places that the Park Service preserves. [Text: {T}here is not a different policy for the removal of graffiti associated with the 2020 protests on NPS properties --- we are removing it as we would any graffiti or other similar form of vandalism. NPS's policy position does not preclude individual states or municipalities from making alternative treatment decisions should they choose to, and the question of whether so doing would impact NR or NHL eligibility of such resources would have to be considered through the normal evaluative process for changes/alterations to eligible or listed properties.] And this is just again to confirm that the current policy for graffiti at the National Park Service sites applies to all graffiti regardless of context removal as soon as possible is what's recommended working under the assumption that's been studied and generally proven that graffiti begets more graffiti. So if people see that an area has already been vandalized, they are more likely to tag that area because the signal's sort of a value judgment of that surface of that area. If vandalized then other people don't value it, then it's OK for me to also vandalize it. Graffiti removal does get complicated if the graffitied surface is historic and needs to be treated with care. As Bill mentioned, this memorial is limestone, which is relatively porous. It absorbs the graffiti material and makes it more difficult to remove. So graffiti often needs a unique approach for removal. And often at park sites, things like sandblasting and power washing, which are generally used on public buildings and urban buildings where graffiti is a big issue, those aren't options on the kinds of resources that we deal with. [A new screen shows a photo on the left featuring an inscription on stone and a photo on the right showing a water tower with painted graffiti reading in part \"Home of the Free Indian.\" The caption below that photo reads \"The newly rebuilt water tower with the restored graffiti Native Americans were invited to participate in tracing over the final block letters, Rameen Rahimian, The New York Times.] Here you see on the left is a photo from the Pioneer Register and Capitol Reef National Park, which is in Utah, it's a canyon wall that holds the names of several early European settlers to the area. And this is what if it happened today we would call it graffiti, but it's not, it is now preserved as a site of historic importance. The park website as well as signage along the trails to the site warns against vandalizing the area, including the graffiti in order to protect these existing inscriptions. And we call them inscriptions when they're important and we call it graffiti when it's unwanted. On the right is an article from 2012 in the New York Times which talks about National Park Service led restoration of graffiti at Alcatraz that's associated with the Native American occupation of the island from 1969 to 1971. The effort to restore that graffiti did include Native American participants in its final stages, and I just I'm showing this slide to highlight the changing attitudes about graffiti and about how other-- the Park Service policy currently dictates that all graffiti be treated equally. It's obvious that there are already differences that exist, and how it is treated depending on age, location and message. Of course, the difference is that these two photos show writing and graffiti that happened before these sites were National Park sites. And Alcatraz didn't believe-- didn't join the NPS until I believe the 1970s. So we have the benefit of time to decide that that graffiti was significant. While graffiti appears at sites that are already National Park units, we're supposed to remove it without considering the potential significance that graffiti will have to future Americans and how it might speak to them about their past. And I'm not suggesting and nobody in the Park Service is suggesting that graffiti be left untreated or that it be left on monuments that are important sites to a lot of people, but it is important that we think about how we might be able to preserve the information that graffiti contains about the culture and the environment in which it was created. [Two pages from the NP Gallery digital asset management system. One features a photo of red paint graffiti on the Golden Gate NRA entrance that reads \"Indians welcome in Indian Land.\" The second page shows the digital asset entry.] And so finally with that in mind, a small group of Park Service employees have been meeting over the past year to develop a system of documentation that we are hoping will digitally preserve modern incidences of graffiti. So that future viewers, including scholars and historians can make the decision about whether or not graffiti is significant or instructive. We are encouraging all NPS staff to record all graffiti not just graffiti that may be associated with current events to relieve them of the responsibility of making that judgment call. Any judgment that we make now any decision about what to preserve and what not to preserve is going to be influenced intentionally or unintentionally by our biases and our own personal histories as stewards and interpreters of these important places. So we're using NP Gallery which is a publicly available and searchable digital asset database. We have a few required metadata fields, and several more recommended fields, but using the database isn't mandatory. So it's suggested as sort of a favor to future historians and future scholars to provide them with information about the unrest and the graffiti that occurred in 2020 should they want that information in the future. But because it's not mandatory, there are limitations in terms of staff and funding. And some parks, the sheer number of instances of graffiti that they deal with, it's not possible for them to record all of that information. So I think this is a first step and just changing our views on how we handle this issue that's really pervasive and widespread but really, I think, deserves some critical thinking.",

            "transcript": "My name is Rob Whitman I am a National Park Service Park Ranger here at the Memorial. On August 19 1813 General Harrison and his officers met with Perry and his naval officers over in Sandusky Bay to discuss strategy for the war between the army and the navy. This is a rare meeting and a beginning of a successful partnership between Perry and Harrison. A couple important things come out of this meeting besides details of how to fight the war. First Perry did not have enough men to fight and sail his vessels for battle. Harrison offers his army up and over a hundred men from his army volunteered to be attached to the navy. Second important thing was Put-in-Bay was chosen to be the base of operation for the US squadron under Perry when it was in the western end of the lake. They chose here for three reasons. First from here you'd be able to watch the Royal Navy if they decide to leave the safety of the Detroit River. Here Perry would also stay in contact with General Harrison and third the bay provided a safe harbor in case of bad weather. The battle of Lake Erie is one of the most pivotal battles of the war in the old northwest and takes place just about in the middle of the war. The battle was important foremost because whoever controlled the lake controlled the ground around it. Control of the lake meant that you could move men and supplies easier than if only relying on land-based transportation. On September 9, 1813 with the US squadron at Put-in-Bay the main supply route for the British had been cut off. The British military was now running low on supplies at Fort Malden. They had two choices retreat or send their squadron out and open the supply route. They chose to fight. Now back at Put-in-Bay 87 out of the 540 men of the US squadron were sick with lake fever including Perry and the squadron's two surgeons. The morning of September 10th the US squadron spots the Royal Navy on the horizon. The US will spend several hours fighting the wind to gain the weather gauge from the British whoever held the weather gauge would have an advantage in the coming battle. After several hours Perry will finally issue the order to turn around and give up his attempt to get the weather gauge but before the order can be followed the wind shifts 180 degrees giving Perry the advantage. During the time it takes to close the distance final preparations for battle are made and Perry stops and talks to his gun crews about the coming battle. Also during this time Perry will bring out his battle flag \"Dont Give Up The Ship\" the final command of his friend Captain James Lawrence who was mortally wounded in the naval battle with the British in June of 1813. The Royal Navy opens the battle about 11:45 for roughly the next two hours the Lawrence Perry's flagship takes on the whole British squadron with the help of just a few smaller US vessels. After those two hours Perry has lost close to 80 percent of his men killed or wounded. All of his carronades on the engaged side are disabled. At this point the British are winning. What is Perry to do? At this low point someone then spots the Niagara moving forward Perry decides to jump in one of the long boats and have a few men roll them over to the Niagara where he takes command and adds more sail. This is the oh shoot moment for the British. Perry just got a brand new boat. As Perry and the Niagara bears down on the British squadron the Detroit and the Queen Charlotte decided to wear ship, turn around, so their unengaged side can now fight the US. At this point the British are feeling the toll the US fire power. Every captain and first officer of every British vessel is killed or wounded. Junior officers are now in command of damaged ships, that are crewed by a large number of soldiers rather than sailors. The Detroit and the Queen Charlotte collide opening a hole in the line for the Niagara to sail into. Perry claims at half pistol range, about 30 yards, he double shots his carronades. The British soldiers and sailors take this pounding fire at close range for about 15 minutes as they work to cut their vessels apart. Barclay wounded comes back to take command but is wounded a second time and is taken below again. The British get their vessels cut apart but the damage is done. At this point the British start surrendering one by one. after the victory Perry writes a quick note to General Harrison. \"Dear General, We have met the enemy and they are ours. Two ships, two brigs, one schooner, and one sloop. Yours with great respect and esteem, O.H. Perry.\" That night the two squadrons lay together off west sister island to care for the wounded and bury the enlisted men at sea. The six officers three American and three British killed in the battle will be buried together on South Bass Island in the days following the battle. This is not the end of the army navy cooperation under Perry and Harrison we'll leave the rest of the story to our friends and neighbors across the lake to continue the tale. Make sure to tune in next week to hear the next segment of Guns Across the Lakes.",

            "transcript": "I want to take a minute to talk about how you can help protect Grand Canyon National Park. Introduced species that cause harm to the ecological health of an area are called invasive species. These species can be plants, animals, or microbes and are usually spread by human activity. A common way for invasive species to be spread is on boats and other watercraft. Recently, an invasive mussel was found in the Colorado River through Grand Canyon National Park. This particularly damaging invasive species is called the quagga mussel. Adult mussels are about the size of your thumb nail, and immature mussels are microscopic. Once introduced, the quagga mussel carpets underwater rock surfaces quickly. These mussels disrupt food webs, clog water intakes and their sharp shells become a recreational hazard. If we don’t clean boats and gear that have been in waters containing this mussel, we will unfortunately spread this invasive species throughout the Colorado River. Everyone with a boat can help by taking three easy steps: Clean, Drain and Dry. These steps should be part of every river trip. Clean means to go around the boat and remove any visible mud or plants and also to take a bucket or hose and rinse the hull and interior of any standing water or debris. Drain means to allow all water to drain out of the boat and any equipment. Dry means that the boat and all equipment should be completely dry before launching on your next trip. Whether you have a dory, raft or kayak – you can move water and invasive species with your boat and gear. Every single boat that arrives at Grand Canyon to float should arrive clean. At the end of your trip you should be sure to clean, drain and dry your boat and all gear before heading out on a new waterway. Grand Canyon National Park takes a number of precautions to ensure that river trips are safe, fun and protect the uniqueness of Grand Canyon. But we all need to help to protect this precious river. Take the Clean Drain Dry steps before and after every boating trip!",

I’m standing in front of the John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site in Brookline, Massachusetts. In 1917, our 35th president was born in this house. In 2017 we celebrated the centennial of President Kennedy’s birth here. This wonderful site is one of 83 national park sites in the region that runs from Maine to Virginia. The Northeast Region also manages programs that help local communities to preserve special places and share their stories through the region’s many national landmarks, wild and scenic rivers, national trails and national heritage areas. In 2017, the National Park Service celebrated its 101st birthday. We’re one year older than President Kennedy. This year, the Parks 101 campaign helped visitors find new parks and rediscover more familiar places. That’s what you’ll see in our 2017 annual report: new audiences, new places, new experiences, new ways to have fun. You’ll also see the dedication of our region’s 3,000 employees, plus the hard work of partners, volunteers and supporters like you. National parks belong to us all. So let’s enjoy them, and find your park!",

            "transcript": "Andrea Whiteplume: Ta'c haláxp 'íinim we'níkt wées hinmatomwínanmay, Andrea Whiteplume. Na'toot hiiwes Burnett Lee Whiteplume Jr., ne'íic hiiwes Ramona Whiteplume. My name is Andrea Whiteplume, again, my name. I come from here in Lapwai, Idaho. I was born and raised here within the Nez Perce homelands. I come from a long line of porcupine quillers and basketry makers and hide tanners and the various artistic forms that we have within our Nimiipuu culture. Andrea Whiteplume: I've been doing quillwork for about 13 years. I learned from my auntie, Lana Street, from North Dakota. She came over and visited our family, and she was working on some quillwork items, and I seen my mom could do quillwork as well, but she wasn't actively doing it at that time. And I became interested, and I asked her some questions, and she just asked me if I wanted to learn. Andrea Whiteplume: I wanted to continue learning these ways because I know that it's important to stay connected to our culture and stay connected to who we are and who we identify ourselves, through how we dress ourselves and how we endure our family, how we present ourselves to the creator, and how we present ourselves to each other and present ourselves to the world. Andrea Whiteplume: This is a cuff that my mother and I made for my dad. We kind of both took turns working on these, on this item. There's a set. This is entirely made out of ... the colors right here are all entirely made out of the porcupine quills. And we get these from harvesting or finding. Nowadays, we find them, usually like a roadkill or you know farmers. Sometimes they think of them as, I guess, pests and they don't want them around in their fields. So that's how we get them, too, is by donation. But these strips that they're wrapped on, they are traditionally rawhide, and the backing for this is leather, and the edging for this is a moose hide. Andrea Whiteplume: This is the otter cape, and the men wear it on their shoulders, on their shoulders and draped over. It's draped over their shoulders like this. But this whole middle part is also just all quillwork. Same thing, all raw hide and porcupine quills, just weaved differently. It's a whole set, but this is the bigger pieces to the outfit, is the cuffs and that middle piece on the otter cape. Andrea Whiteplume: I've taught my daughter. My daughter is still in the beginning stages of learning how to do quillwork. Right now, we're working on patience, on sorting, because it takes a lot of patience. You know you get a porcupine, and you pull all the quills off, and then you're going through and you're picking and choosing between each porcupine quill, which one to keep and which one to ..how you're going to use it. And primarily, you want to get the longer, not too thick, not too thin quills to make, to have them come out even so your designs look nice. Andrea Whiteplume: The materials I need to perform the medium of quillwork, we have a close connection to our environment, with porcupine. Porcupine is a symbol of protection. And having the rawhide, we use it from our four-legged relatives, either the deer or the elk or the moose or buffalo. We stretch the hide and we cut the strips from them. And it's important that we gather these things within our home because then we are having, establishing or we have this ... these are all actions of gratitude for our relatives, our animal relatives that you know we've learned a lot from these relatives, and they're some of our oldest teachers, and this is how we can take care of ourselves. So, it's important. Andrea Whiteplume: Historically, it was women, women did the quillwork, and times have changed. A lot of men do this work as well. And a lot of the traditional aspects behind it, you know a lot of it is it's a high trade value item. We kind of had a little bit of a disconnect for the Nez Perce because we have a lot of bead work, very beautiful, intricate bead work and designs, but prior to colonization and the trade routes that we have, we endured ourselves with this quillwork. Andrea Whiteplume: This set is used with more bright, vibrant colors. It's more for like a teenage to a woman size person. The backing on here is buckskin and instead of the straight lines, these are cut in circles. And these are two-rowed medallions and hair ties. And one of the more modern things is having a little bow. A lot of girls like having the little bow in their hair. But having the different various colors, you need to have more quills, so it takes a little bit more time, and it takes a lot of effort and a lot of work, and a lot of love and things go into these, making these types of things for young women. As times have changed, women have learned to endear themselves and learn to dress up themselves as well as the men. And with these items, we can help support and heal and show our love for the woman folk as well. Andrea Whiteplume: Bringing home our artifacts from our ancestors is important because we are healing, we are healing people. We've been through a lot of trauma, and the rekindlement of our relationship to ourselves is important, and it's the most self love we can do for our people. So I think it's very important that these, our ancestral artifacts come home and return and help us guide us along through that journey.",

            "transcript": "Hi, I’m Ranger Kenny, here with you on the slickrock of Zion National Park. Even on a planet where life seemingly thrives in all environments, few creatures dare to call this alien terrain home. But in this most bizarre setting lurks an equally bizarre creature. Triops Longicaudatus, also known as the tadpole shrimp, depends on the temporary waters of desert potholes to live out its unique life cycle. While these potholes provide a crucial water source for many creatures in the desert, it is their impermanence that matters most to the tadpole shrimp. Their life begins as a tiny egg, roughly the size of a sand grain, laid in the bottom of a pool shortly before it dries out. Once the water evaporates, the egg goes into a period of diapause, a phase of dormancy until favorable conditions return. Dormant eggs are incredibly hardy. They may remain viable for decades waiting for water to return, withstanding temperatures up to 208 degrees (f) and well below freezing with no ill effect. Once the pool dries out, the eggs lie in wait. Rain alone will not cause hatching, but if an adequate amount of water fills the pool – enough to last at least a few days - the egg springs to life, and out pops a tiny triops. The triops develops quickly, going from egg to adult in less than 6 days. It may live for 20 to 90 days, if its home pool lasts that long. Tadpole shrimp eat just about any plant or animal they can find – including each other. While tiny bits of organic debris compose the bulk of triops’ diet, these creatures also play a critical part in pest control by feeding on mosquito eggs and larvae that inhabit the same ephemeral pools. The extraordinary adaptations of triops longicaudatus, from its uniquely resilient eggs to its indiscriminate appetite, have allowed it to thrive since the time of the dinosaurs. The basic design of these creatures has changed little in more than 70 million years, making it a living fossil. The longevity of such a humble creature, thriving through mass extinctions and drastic changes in climate, speak to the versatility of its design. It’s short life in a fleeting environment make it one of many treats in Zion reserved for those with an eye for the little details.",

            "transcript": "[waves lapping on a shoreline] [Ben Becker] Biodiversity is a short term for biological diversity. The main definition is: the number of different species—how many different types of animals or plants or fungi are in a system. Within each one of those species, there's genetic diversity. And then, we also have community diversity. And a biological community is made up of the groups of species that are within that community. [hammering] If you think about your lawn, or you think about an area that's just a cornfield, these are monocultures; there's just one species in there. And we have to apply pesticides to these areas. We have to go in there and remove the pests and we're always fighting weeds. You can see how easily these areas are invaded when they're just a monoculture. But when we have a healthy, high biodiversity system, they're able to often fend off these invaders, these pests, and everything maintains themselves at equilibrium much better. By having more species in your environment, there are more species with different jobs—different nutrient recycling jobs, different decomposition jobs. Having high biodiversity in your system also improves the efficiency of that system to fix carbon, to cycle nutrients through the system, which are important for all the other forms of life. Habitats are often the substrate that biodiversity is placed upon. So, different habitats...rocky habitats will host one type of community of biodiversity, you know, a particular assemblage of sea stars or algae. Whereas, the same habitat might have a completely different biodiversity assemblage. And different sandy habitats in different areas might have relatively similar biodiversity, but there might be some components of that biodiversity that are different. [waves lapping on a shoreline] One thing to consider when you think about biodiversity is our knowledge of biodiversity in the world is really quite limited. We probably, all together, know or have cataloged under two million species that occur in the world. And this is everywhere—this is rain forests, this is oceans, this is desert. A lot of scientists estimate that there are as many as 30 million species around the world. [waves lapping on a shoreline] Throughout the world, there are a lot of different reasons that we lose biodiversity. The main reason is usually habitat loss, but another big reason is invasive species. These are species from another system, from another part of the world, that are brought in. They're almost like weeds. [waves lapping on a shoreline] Along this bay, we are looking at the biodiversity within this bay, because there are several threats to this bay that we want to understand how to control these threats—threats like habitat loss. We might lose some of our biological communities if we lose some of our rocky habitats or some of our sandy habitats to development or to pollution. We can only understand how to control the threats and what the impacts of these threats are if we understand what the biological diversity is inside the bay. [waves lapping on a shoreline] What we're doing right now, we're doing an inventory so that we understand how many species are there and what their population levels are. So, we have groups of scientists that go out, look at particular group of organisms—algae or invertebrates or fishes—monitor in the field through different capturing techniques or different monitoring techniques, whether they're going out, collecting them, taking them back into the laboratory to identify some of these species that are very difficult to identify without a microscope. And they can look at what species are there. Also, the distribution of those species around the bay. And then, we can go back later and say: \"Are these habitats changing?\" \"Has this habitat been affected by pollution?\" \"Has this habitat been affected by heavy fishing pressure?\" \"Has this been affected by an invasive species coming in from another environment that might be displacing our particular species?\" So, we're basically quantifying the distribution and how many there are in a particular area, and then tracking that over time. [waves lapping on a shoreline] We have what we call all of these different taxonomic working groups. Some are working on algae, some on fishes, some on microscopic phytoplankton. Some people are working on birds, some on mammals, and all of them work in their own respective area to do this inventory [waves lapping on a shoreline] Often, researchers, when they're working in a system—if they're working on fishes or they're working on a particular type of habitat—they often work in relative isolation. They communicate with one another about what their findings are, but their data and their analyses are often separate. Here, we have a group, a large group of scientists, graduate students, and, also, community members and students, who are all working together on this project. They go out on their own to do their particular surveying and inventory, but they all do it in a similar manner, so computer, one database system. So, if we want to map biodiversity around the bay, or if we want to look for hotspots of invasive species, or these are the most biodiverse areas, or these are the areas that are threatened, we can look at the information from invertebrates, from algae, all the different types of habitats, all together. [waves lapping on a shoreline] This project is really a community project. So, what we've done is we've gone out to the community, to the scientific community, to the educational community, and, also, to the local environmental community, and, also, the agricultural community. And we've formed a group that is all interested in helping to catalog what the biodiversity is of this bay. So, that's one of the beautiful parts of this project is we've got the algae people and the fish people and the habitat people all talking together, so that we can look for these trends in biodiversity, not just in one particular group, like fishes or invertebrates, but what's going on with all of the biodiversity in this part of the bay where there might be a high impact. [waves lapping on a shoreline] Biodiversity is really important for several reasons It's important to humans, in the way that we live our lives. Most of our foods are derived from natural sources. At least 25 or 30% of our medicines are derived from plants in the wild. Having a diverse system often fills up all of the little niches in the environment, making it more difficult for invasive species to come in, or making it less likely that populations are going to decline.

            "transcript": "Maggie: Hi everyone. My name is Maggie Vetch, and I am a Park Ranger with the Niobrara National Scenic River in Valentine, Nebraska. I am with the National Park Service and joined today by Emily Fisher, who will introduce herself. Emily: Hi, I'm Emily Fisher and I am with the Nebraska Writing Project. And we are so pleased to bring this special opportunity to you. Maggie: So we will be learning today about the Niobrara National Scenic River and its prehistoric species through geology and paleontology. So first things first, we want to explore what is the Niobrara National Scenic River and what makes it so special? Emily: Okay. The first thing that you're going to need throughout this whole lesson is a thinking tracker. And basically what this is, it's a T-chart, so grab a piece of paper, draw a line down the middle. And what you're going to do is you're going to think about what It Says, and then what I Say. It Says is basically anything that is a text. Now remember, texts can be pictures, texts can be what Maggie is going to talk to you about. Text doesn't just have to be writing on a page. So you're going to be able to take information that you're given or you learn, and then when you have I Say, that's where you can think about what you think about that information. So questions you have, ideas you have, basically it's up to you. Maggie: So the Niobrara National Scenic River is a National Park Service site in North-Central Nebraska. So we protect 76 miles of scenic river starting in Valentine, Nebraska, and then going to the east, we have six different ecosystems that meet at the river's banks, including three different forests and three prairie systems. So the roadmap for this lesson is that we're going to cover geology and paleontology on the Niobrara River. We'll talk about five different soil layers that have formed over time along the river's banks. And for paleontology, we're going to be talking about some specific eras in time. Why we're doing this is we want to see how geology and paleontology work together to tell the story of climate change and landscape change over time, and give us a bigger picture and a different lens to look at history with. Emily: Okay. So you're going to grab that thinking tracker and you're going to think about some of the information that you just learned from Maggie. So I wrote down that she said putting the soils and location of the fossils together tells a story of climate and landscape change over time. And that's what I learned from the information. And what I say about this, I had never thought about how geology and paleontology could give me two very different versions of history. So there was a lot of really cool information that Maggie said there. For example, there are 76 miles of Scenic River, there's six different ecosystems along the Niobrara River. So you could think about some of those things and take a minute to write down something that you learned from Maggie under 'It Says' and then write down what that makes you think, question, wonder, or anything like that on your thinking tracker. Maggie: So in this next section of our lesson, we're going to explain a little bit more about the story of the running river through time. So the Niobrara River has been flowing for many, many years but there also was a period when it wasn't here yet. So where does our story start? The Mesozoic Era is that first big chunk of time that we are going to talk about today, and that has the Jurassic period and the Cretaceous period within it. And then we're going to jump into our second chapter, which is the Cenozoic Era. And there's a lot of different periods of time within it. They're all listed there - Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, Pliocene, Pleistocene, Holocene, and there is a lot of vocab in this lesson. So we'll break it down a little bit further as we go, but just know that there's a couple of different chapters in this story. Where we're going to start is probably your first question, which is, where are the dinosaurs in all of this? When we think of Paleontology, which is the study of fossils and the remains that have been found in soil over time, we usually think of the dinosaurs, but our story on the Niobrara doesn't start with dinosaurs. In the Mesozoic Era, there is the Jurassic and the Cretaceous periods, which we talked about a little bit. The Jurassic period was the age of the dinosaurs. So this is when dinosaurs were roaming across North America. You would know T-Rex, Stegosaurus, Brontosaurus, kind of those big names. And the cool thing is we didn't have any dinosaurs in North Central Nebraska. And that's because we were under water. There's a sea that runs through North America and it's very shallow, kind of almost tropical - clear blue waters, warm, there are sharks in it, there's early fish. You've got clams and corals and just this abundant life in the sea that you would never think of in the middle of North America. But on the slide, there's a couple of photos of the mosasaurs and the plesiosaurus, which are the big prehistoric reptiles that were actually living in these seas and oceans in North-Central Nebraska of all places. So we found early shark fossils, we found plesiosaurus which look like the Loch Ness Monster with these big long necks and they ate any fish or smaller animals they could find. They were great predators. Slowly as you move down to that Jurassic Era, when the dinosaurs elsewhere in North America were slowly dying off, the mosasaur came along, which is this long eel-like creature that you can see on the slide. And the mosasaur was a ferocious predator. It ate clams, it ate plesiosaurus which were very large. But it also ate fish, sharks, turtles, smaller reptiles, and it could crawl up on land a little bit, but the earth was becoming a little more swampy, so these creatures had to be highly adaptable and use what they could to their advantage. But this last picture on the slide is actually the soil layer that formed when that cretaceous sea, that inner continental seabed dried up. So that's called the Pierre Shale Layer, and it's the lowest one that we identify on the Niobrara River in our geologic story through time. Emily: Okay. So that was so informative, thanks Maggie, and interesting. So what I would like you to do is pick something that you learned or that you took a special interest in and write that down. I was really interested in the abundance of life, and it was more like a tropical shallow sea with clear blue water. So I might write that down and that makes me think about, what kind of fossils are actually under or in the soil in Nebraska that I had never considered? And so I'm just really curious to think about that. So take a moment and write a couple of those things down, share with partners. Go ahead and pause here. Maggie: So the next stop on our story is to move out of the blue zone, that Cretaceous Era and into the orange era, which is the Cenozoic Era. And the Cenozoic era is known for mammals. There's this column of catastrophic events that we've got written down on our table here. And there's the theory that an asteroid hit the Gulf of Mexico. The Yucatan Peninsula and that massive climate changes were happening. And that's when the sea started to dry up. And there was lots of ash and smog and all of a sudden the waters are receding from the area of Nebraska and life is changing because the environment and the landscape are changing. So as we journey into the Eocene and the Oligocene and even the Miocene, which is our next chapters, we're going to be looking at the mammals that became abundant along the Niobrara River and in North Central Nebraska. The Eocene is a fun period because Nebraska was almost like a tropical Oasis. You'll see, in this top photo, it looks flat. It looks like Nebraska. There's some trees and some grasses and some water, but the creatures that were roaming during this time were well adapted to warm-wet climate. There were these rhinos called Titanotheres who had these big horned front -- they weren't even tusks or horns. They were just this growth off of the nose, but it looks like the ancestor of the rhino. And you can see then this lower left-hand picture is these very, very small almost deer or horse looking creatures. And those are actually some of the earliest horses that we find that originated in Nebraska and they were very small. They were the size of goats. These very small horses had three hooves. So instead of that one big hook that we normally see, they actually had two other toes sticking out the sides. So in this era we see rhinos and horses. And then we're going to discover a couple more species along the way as well. And then we walk into the next chapter, which is the Oligocene, and this is a period of explosive biodiversity. So life is growing and changing and new species are popping up. This upper left-hand photo is a depiction of what most we'll say the Niobrara looked like at that time. You've got more prairies, the soil is becoming a little drier, a little more arid, there's trees that are growing. And they're the trees that we identify more today. So like those Oaks, and just those taller leafy trees, instead of more of those sub-tropic trees that we think of. The horses are still roaming the prairie, they are eating grass, and they're eating the leaves off of trees. So they're getting a little taller, longer necks. They still have a couple toes, not just one hoof. But you'll also see in this era that we've got more cousins of those horses. We've got early zebras and we also have an exciting development that the camels are coming. And these camels are a little different than you would think of. They don't have big humps, they're not those dromedaries. But they've got a little bit of a smoother back. But they're different than the horses. They are definitely their own species at this point. There are also rhinos, and some early elephants, like the prehistoric ancestors of the elephants coming at this time. There's a really fun picture in the middle here of what's called a bear dog. And there were predators at this time, it wasn't just those browsing, or grass and leaf eating mammals. There were also predators. And so the bear dog is just one that we know of. There were also early cats, early canines, so the ancestors of wolves and dogs. But they're walking on this soil that came from explosions out in Wyoming and Colorado, those mountains are still forming to the west of us. And so all of the dust and ash from those mountain forming explosions is actually drifting into what would be Nebraska and settling where this soil is becoming drier into what's called the Rosebud Layer. It's very hard packed. And so this upper right hand photo is actually -- you can see the red, and that darker dirt color in the wall. That's the Rosebud Layer. Between the Rosebud Layer and the one that we're going to talk about next, the Valentine Layer is actually where our waterfalls flow out of. Which comes about in the Miocene, is more porous, it's more sandy. It's almost like a sandstone, it'll hold water really well. And that lets us know also that the climate is changing. So into the Miocene, we've got even more life if you can believe it. There are elephants roaming the early Gomphotherium and Amebelodon you can see him in these photos on the slide. They've got different shapes of tasks, they have four tasks instead of two; just fascinatingly different than the elephants we know today. And what's interesting is the climate is still drying out more and more, and some of those taller trees are dying off. But the grasslands that we know and are familiar to us on the Great Plains are becoming vast and broad. And so many of the browsers those that ate leaves off of trees are not doing quite as well in this era. And a lot of the grazers that ate shorter plants and grasses are doing really, really well. So we see herds of camels thriving. And it almost looks like an African savanna of what we would think of today, where you've got elephants and camels with long necks that almost look like giraffes. You've got the early deer, you have horses where those three toes we talked about earlier are going away, you're getting to see more of those one-hoofed horses that look a lot more like we know. There are still a couple of rhinos, we're getting closer to the end of their life just because climate can't support them as much as it used to. It's getting a little too dry. The resources they need to survive and thrive are slowly just being eaten away by changes in climate, changes in landscape. There's also a really fun picture of this horned rodent, which might be like an early gopher or an early groundhog. These mammals are so familiar to us. And we can tell from their fossils and in this soil layer, the Valentine Layer, that they were walking and living on. We find a lot of fossils. They're really well preserved and it gives us a great fossil record that tell us about this era in time. And actually it's the lower right hand picture on this slide, that's the Valentine Layer. And then above it, that's where our Ash Hollow Layer comes in. And that's from explosions in Idaho, and even further west that we're blowing into the Great Plains, just settling and becoming the dirt that these mammals walked on. Emily: Oh wow, thanks, Maggie. That was so interesting. I'm learning so much about the climate of these prehistoric times and what it might have been like for these animals to continue living throughout this time. So go ahead and maybe pick one or two things, there was a whole lot of really awesome information there. I was really struck by how Nebraska's climate went from wet, to dry to becoming drier to support grasslands. All the way -- when we talked about from this, used to be a shallow sea. And thinking about how Colorado and Wyoming and Idaho have impacted Nebraska as well. So pick something to write down about \"It Says\" about the climate, or the animals or anything that really stood out to you, and then write down what you have to say about it. And we'll pause here and you can share when your teacher says so. Maggie: So next chapter in our story, we're going to be looking into the Pliocene and the Pleistocene. And now we're going to talk about the next set of climate changes that were coming through North Central Nebraska. And now we're going to see a dive in biodiversity because the landscape couldn't support what these mammals needed. Things were changing too fast, and the resources they needed were going away. So in the Pliocene, we're still seeing those broad grasslands, those rhinos are kind of hitting the end. They're out of the resources they need to do well, but we're still going to see elephants, camels, horses, and we're going to see some fun developments like a saber-toothed cats coming around. The elephant species are changing, they're going from those four tusked Gomphotherium and Amebelodon into what we know as the mammoth or the mastodon. Those big roaming creatures that just travelled far and wide for whatever they needed. So what's really fun is that the camels during this time, actually we're about eight feet tall. These are really long, long, long necks, they almost look like giraffes, which is interesting. And the horses, what's fun is now they look a lot more like the horses that we know today. They've got that the singular hoof. And you can see in the photo, they are just roaming these vast grasslands. But things are getting colder into the Pleistocene. There are glaciers coming from Minnesota and Iowa, on to what would be the Eastern side of Nebraska. So we didn't necessarily have glaciers sitting on top of the Niobrara River Valley, but we had mammals that were trying to outrun the glaciers. So you'll see the mammoth with the big rolling tusks, and the mastodon with the shorter two tasks, you can see that the tusks on the mammals are really big and you're wondering, \"Why is that so different than the than the mastodon with these short little tasks?\" And it's because the mammoth used those big tusks to clear out snow and ice and find the resources it needed beneath the snow. And so these mammals had to travel far and wide. They were not in one place. But we've still got those horses, they are also living on the edge of the glaciers, browsing or grazing and eating grasses. And also then those giant camels are still here. The fossil records in Nebraska, I think there's only three or four, maybe five counties in Nebraska where there haven't been mammoth or mastodon remains. Which is just incredible that they were thriving along, not just the Niobrara, but the entire Great Plains that we know. So the glaciers would have been growing and receding five or six times. Slowly, you'll see those horses that have migrated elsewhere, the camels have just died off and the Pleistocene becomes known as this Ice Age. This strange period of time in North America. Emily: All right. So a whole bunch of really awesome information there as well. Write down a couple things about what you heard that kind of stood out to you. I'm just thinking about how only a few counties in Nebraska don't have mastodon or mammoth remains. I could write that down, I could say, “That’s amazing.” I had no idea that they were so widespread across the Great Plains. I knew they were here, but I didn't know that they were all over the place. So go ahead and take a minute write down a couple things, write down questions or comments or things you're thinking, we'll have you pause the video and share. Maggie: So the last stops on our story, we're not going to cover very in depth because we're starting to know them well. The climate after the Ice Age warms up, it becomes very arid grasslands are still doing really well. The Niobrara River is flowing through these canyon, there are pockets of cooler spaces where now we have aspen trees. The sand hills have formed here. We've got dunes that are covered in grasses. But we've got humans, we've got Bison, we're starting to see horses that we know. The seasons are returning, we're starting to see three to four seasons a year. And the predominant predator is the human. The Holocene is the last chapter, which we're actually still living in right now. Now we can look back and see the drastic story of changes in landscape and climate that the Niobrara River has experienced and how our geology and paleontology work together to give us a different view of what was happening years and years ago. Emily: So now that when you've taken some time to learn about the Niobrara Scenic River in prehistoric times, now we're going to write a little bit about it. And we're going to really kind of capitalize on your imagination and your ideas. So if you need to go back and reference that timeline, as you're thinking through that, that'd be a great resource. But I want you to remember when it comes to writing, we're going to be working really on drafting here. So the point will be to get your ideas out onto the paper. So what we're going to think about is really what surprised you about prehistoric species along the Niobrara Scenic River in Nebraska. There were a lot of things that surprised me. So go ahead and really think about what was one of the most surprising things that you heard. And what you're going to do, is you're going to choose one species. And if you can't exactly remember the name, that's okay. We're going to show you some pictures in just a minute but maybe I'm thinking the one that really surprised me. So maybe I'm thinking back to the Mosasaurus, back when Nebraska was under this shallow sea and it almost reminds me of Caribbean tropical waters. You’re going to think about that, and you're going to choose one, and you're going to be able to reference your thinking tracker, or your notes, and also that timeline for when we're writing. So here are some of the species that we discussed. Maggie, would you just go ahead and give us a quick reminder of what each one is? Maggie: Absolutely. So the first photo, in the upper left hand corner is our mosasaur, kind of a long eel looking reptile. And next to them, we've got the early camels, they ate grasses and roamed far and wide in herds. Then we've got in the bottom left hand corner, an ancestor of the rhino. And this isn't titanotheres, this is a cousin. And they would have lived kind of in that warmer, tropical wet, and done pretty well when there were trees and leafy hardy plants to feed. And then our middle photo is actually early horse. And you can see in this photo a little bit like those three toes that we talked about. And then we've got this ancestor of the early elephant. So this is a four-tusked Gomphotherium, and they would have eaten, like it shows, the leaves off of trees. Emily: Okay. So what we're going to do in the next few minutes is kind of tell the surprising tale of one of these prehistoric species. What I want you to remember is, we're in this kind of drafting stage, so you don't need to worry about your spelling, you don't need to worry about your grammar. You just need to get your ideas out on the page. And I want you to remember your topic is whichever prehistoric species you want to write about. The purpose is really to inform but it’s kind of a creative way to inform because you're really going to imagine that you are these species. So I want you to imagine that you're there and really visualize and you think about those descriptive terms. What does it feel like? What does the air feel like? Is it humid? What does it smell like? What can you hear? What other animals can you hear? So really personify or bring to life what it would be like to be this creature. And your audience, you're writing for people just like you were us who need to learn a little bit more about Nebraska in prehistoric times. So what you're going to do is your teacher is going to have a timer, so you're just going to write for two minutes and then we'll pause. So the first thing that you're going to do is you're going to describe what you can see, hear or smell, using all those senses along the Niobrara river in prehistoric times. Now, remember if you're a mosasaur, it's going to be a little bit different because you're going to be swimming in a shallow ocean than if you are an early relative of the elephant. You're going to be seeing different things. Now don't start yet till your teacher tells you. If you're having a hard time saying, “Emily, I don't really know how to start this,” use the sentence I gave you. “As I look upon the landscape, my eyes are drawn to,” so you're writing in first person as if you are this creature. Two minutes, okay. And if you get stuck, just keep going. It's always okay to just keep writing and thinking about what you could see, hear, or smell. Okay. Go ahead and listen to your teacher for when you're going to start. All right, fantastic. I'm so proud of you for going ahead and really envisioning that. The next thing that we're going to think about in regards to telling a story, it's always important when we're thinking about a character or in terms here at the prehistoric creature about things that we worry about or are concerned. So what you're going to do for the next two minutes is write about your worries or your fears or your concerns about life along the river. So you can think about -- we heard that climate change or the change in climate was like a big continual threat. And as Maggie said, we know that there were predators there, we know that there were grass grazers, and then there were these predators there. So you can think about that kind of stuff. So if you need something to help you to start it, you're going to start off with, “Although the landscape is,” and you're going to fill in the blank, “I worry that.” Remember that's just a starter, then you keep going from there. Your teacher is going to tell you when to start. Two more minutes, go. All right. So now we've talked about what maybe makes us worry, now we're going to have two minutes to talk about greatest strengths. So Maggie already told us a lot about how some of these animals had different strengths or what are they really, really, really good at. And so I want you to think about what are your greatest strengths or what do you like most about yourself, or this is sometimes fun to think about, why do other creatures like you, or why do other creatures fear you? And so you can think about your weaknesses or maybe what you want to do to improve. So there's a lot of ideas here, but two minutes to think about this and write about this, listen to your teacher, go ahead and start. Okay, fantastic. The next two minutes, what are your hopes and what are your dreams? Think about you as the creature, what do you really hope for? Do you hope for a continual food supply, do you hope that the climate continues to be whatever you need it to be? And so you want to maybe think about that. So go ahead and for two minutes, write about what you hope, what you dream, and if you need to sentence then, you can start with, “I hope that.” Okay, go. All right. Finally, this one only has one minute, but what do you want history to remember about you? And we know that we have these fossils in Nebraska and we're learning about them, but from your perspective as a prehistoric animal, what would you want history to remember about you? And why is that important? So if you need a sentence to start, you can write, “I want people to remember or history will remember me because.” Go ahead. All right. So now it comes down to sharing your surprising tales about their prehistoric species. The one thing that I might ask you to do is either title your writing with the species that you wrote about, or at the end, you could say, “I am,” and whatever the species it is. And remember, these are drafts. And so these are just works in progress. So if you want to go back and add more details, look back at the timeline. Maggie is going to tell you about some resources where you could go. This could be a really amazing way for you to tell even more about the surprising tale of your prehistoric feature from Nebraska. Maggie: So if you want to learn more, you can find resources from the Nebraska Writing Project and the National Writing Project on their websites. And to dig deeper into the geology and paleontology of the Niobrara National Scenic River, you can check out our website, which is www.nps.gov\\niob, N-I-O-B, and find our paleontology and geology pages. There are also other resources that we will link to in kind of the video notes. Quick credit to our slide deck from SlidesCarnival, and a big thank you in partnership to the Nebraska Writing Project. We are so grateful to work with them at the National Park Service, to put this lesson together for your classroom, and feel free to reach out to Niobrara National Scenic River. If you have any questions about this lesson or the resources used, and we will be very helpful in finding you what you need. [Audio Ends] [00:30:50]",

            "transcript": "- Hello everyone. This is Nick Sacco, park ranger at Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site in St. Louis, Missouri and you're watching episode ten of the U.S. Grant History Chat. And it's my distinct pleasure today to be speaking with Dr. Holly Pinheiro Jr. He is a professor of history at Augusta college in Georgia and I was really excited to have Dr. Pinheiro on today because his scholarship is really exploring the African American experience during the Civil War era. And it's not so much about United States colored troops and military experiences, but family experiences, and the importance of understanding the experiences of African American women and children, and the ways that wars shaped black families during this time. So to start off our conversation, Dr. Pinheiro, what sort of specifically sparked your interest in history and exploring the Civil War era more specifically? - Well, first off, thank you very much for this opportunity and I'm looking forward to it. My interest, I mean, I actually think about this quite a bit. I would say it would be my uncles, when I was probably about seven years old, giving me Frederick Douglass' biography and Malcolm X's biography. And I would say being committed to me learning the history of the African American experience in a way that wasn't always discussed in middle and high school. And then the continue on of that is history was the only class that really moved me in a way to, I mean, I love my job. I get paid to ask questions and read about them. Like, I love it. I mean, cause it's like, I'm always like, ooh, I have a new question. Why is? So I think that for me is what makes history fun and exciting and engaging. - Absolutely. Yeah. I read Frederick Douglass's, his first autobiography early on in school, very influential and talked about watching the movie Glory, was also a big inspiration for me to get into history in the first place too. Absolutely. Now some of your scholarships that I've had the chance to read, you've really stressed the importance of understanding African American women, the ways that they sort of aided the Union war effort and aided their husbands on the battlefield. Would love to hear just some of your insights into this particular topic, which has not always been explored by Civil War historians. - So I think that for me, it's more about, my research is looking at the Northern African American experience, for those, who in many cases were free-born, in places like Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and New York City, New York. There's been a lot of great scholarship on the border and Southern experiences, so whether we're talking Stephanie McCurry, Thavolia Glymph has got a new book out, you know, Silber and Catherine Clinton's \"Divided Houses\", which is like a classic, right? One of those you must read. And the new one by the University of Georgia Press, which I believe is the \"Household War.\" There are so many, right? But I think I've always been curious about what is life like for African Americans, the non-elites, right? So the non-Fortens, the non-Purvises, the working class, the working poor individuals who we often recognize are very essential, right? To abolitionism, but also to just community survival. In my dissertation, which compared Philly and New York, I learned that it was African American women that were doing the mobilization for literacy and these places, they're the ones canvassing going door to door to get wider readership for The Christian Recorder, which was one of the most important African American presses that was tied to the African Methodist Episcopal Church. But also as my book and research highlights, they're the ones publishing along with the weekly Anglo African, the letters and stories of black soldiers. Which is awesome because it's a great mouthpiece, which does have its problems, but it brings to light the Black story in a different way, compared to when looking at The New York Times or other presses at that moment. I think there is a lot that can continue to be said about what does it mean for African American families who are free-born and their experiences in the 19th century. The pieces that you're highlighting, I wanted to unpack the importance of African American women in the North and the wartime mobilization, right? That Williams, Serrel, and others have noted, rightfully so, that it was black women going to the camps, whether we're talking at Rikers Island, where the 20th, the 26th, and 31st United States Colored Infantry are training. So provide them with care, right? But also in Philly, where the 3rd, 6th, 8th, and many other regiments are going to mobilize and train at Camp William Penn. They're the ones doing the canvassing for the money for the regimental flags. They're at these public events. So Alessandra Lorini, she often talks about, that they're being visible in these public spaces, and what that means. Judith Giesberg's work in others, a highlight that they're putting themselves on the line by taking public transportation to go visit these military camps to be seen. And I put quotes around that, as women, when they're always seen as women every day in their communities, right? And it's just, they're trying to force white society to recognize what they already know every second of every day. Right? And it's, it's a very complicated aspect. My, hopefully, next book, will unpack this even more about the racial politics of wartime mobilization in places like Philadelphia, because there is a privileging of white women, but there's not so much, black women have to find other ways to involve themselves and be recognized for it in these spaces. - Yeah. And one thing that I remembered distinctly, is you talk about Congressman William Kelley from Pennsylvania and how he addressed African American women, but he had this tendency. He always referred to them as girls and not women. And it just really stuck to me is, you know, condescending, but it's also just another way to sort of highlight a wedge between the ways politicians looked at white women and their contributions and African American women. - Yeah. Well that, and actually that piece is also part of the book. I mean, you're referring to one of the famous speeches that also Anna Dickinson was a part of and Frederick Douglas, but yeah. When Congressman Kelley steps on the stage, he takes a very different approach to everyone else. I think in some ways it's telling because he is acknowledging the importance of women's role in the wartime mobilization, right? Like, so there is that empowering aspect, but then he does go exactly a negative way by saying that their only value is through their femininity and in like their connections, but not through what they're doing as far as supporting and what they have been doing anyway with helping refugees that are coming into these cities, 'cause Charlotte Forten talks about that in her memoirs, for example. So they're part of these societies that have been helping, you know, African Americans in many ways. But, yeah, one of the interesting quotes I think is when he goes after mothers, black mothers specifically, and says something like, \"Mothers, you suffered through the pangs of maternity to create a man.\" Right? And it's like, that line just really annoyed me on so many levels, because it's like, they are men, every second of every day, just like these are women. But he's saying that if these men don't serve, then they're cowards. So therefore, what does it say about the women? But as my book will unpack, it's like a lot of these men come home. If they do come home, right? With various disabilities, seen and unseen, that are gonna create a lot of lasting problems for these families. And one of the key points of the book, which does center around the families, is that I believe that it's important to not just focus on the Civil War, right? When we talk about the Black experience in Philadelphia. Because the book is going from 1850 up until the 1930s. Right? Talk, about to highlight that, African Americans have been in a war every second of their lives for survival against racism, right? And that the Civil War opens up a new pathway to fight this. But then at the same time also shows them that racism is going to persist anyway, within the structures of military service or the racial politics of a pension. - Sure, sure. So you're kind of navigating that system in a new way, in a sense? Absolutely. Now, here in St. Louis, historically we had, we had Benton Barracks, which is in North St. Louis. It's a park today, but the USCT soldiers, the black soldiers that served out of St. Louis, some of them were free African Americans who came from places like Kansas and Iowa, and were stationed here in St. Louis. But, with your focus on Northern cities and Northern mobilization, love to hear a little bit about what that experience might have been like. I know one thing you mentioned in your scholarship is that free Blacks in Philadelphia, a lot of them chose not to serve in USCT regiments during the war. So I'd love to hear a little bit about that. - Yeah, I mean, so that actually gets to the core of the book. Since I'm focusing on 178 soldiers that I can prove through the records were serving and enlisted in either the 3rd, the 6th, or the 8th USCI, United States Colored Infantry, which were mobilized and trained in Philadelphia, because I really wanted to unpack how do local African Americans, who are dealing with a city that has one of the most contentious histories of racial violence, large and small, how they understand, supported, and didn't, wartime mobilization. And also since there is a strong Black church component and communal support, there's the Institute for Colored Youth. Like there's a lot happening in Philly. Like it is without question, a very important city to focus on, but a lot of the families, or the people don't enlist, right? So the majority of people that are coming in to serve in these regiments are from either neighboring counties or states, or as maybe a future article of mine will unpack, a lot of them from international like locations. They're from Canada, they're from Cuba, they're from Jamaica, from Germany. I mean, they're from all over, which is to me, highlights that these regiments, as other scholars have already noted, they don't necessarily represent their city or state. They represent the Black experience, right? Because they're free-born, they're freed, they're American, they're everywhere. And that they for different reasons are coming to engage in this combat. I believe my second chapter actually talks about the politics of recruiting, right? So in each location, whether we're talking Boston, Massachusetts, New York City, New York, and Philadelphia, they're actually competing with each other and complaining in the press about why are all the Black Philadelphians actually going up to Boston? Why are they going to New York? Why aren't they coming here? We heard a rumor that they're in Rhode Island. And I imagined that that is also playing out when we talk about other locations, whether we're talking about the Iowa 60th, or even in the border areas. Because one of my soldiers, Benjamin Davis, and you track his family throughout this. And to that point, this is actually a study of about a thousand individuals. So even though it's 178 soldiers, it's about their families. The Davis's have a very sad story. Benjamin tried to enlist in the 54th Massachusetts. In doing so, he leaves his wife, who was pregnant with their only son. He misses the birth of Jerome. Their child. And he gets a staph infection along the way. And in the opening of the book, I highlight his widow, Mary Leaden, who basically says in 1884, what was the point? You, as the United States Army and government took away my husband for this thing, and our family has suffered. And in many ways, she's basically saying, she's asking these bigger questions that I think we need to think about is, what does it mean for a family, who have to live with the consequences of this, who are struggling every second of every day against the oppressiveness of racism, right? That's navigating through education, employment, living situations. And now you've taken away an important individual because even children are gonna, as the book talks about, some of these future soldiers, actually didn't go to school and they worked, and they were critical to their households. So once you take them away, their families are going to suffer in some horrific and lasting ways. The story's not as positive as some would like it to be, I think. - Sure. Absolutely. And, you know, I think you're getting to some of the larger questions that historians and those of us in the parks service, like to address that, you know, we have to kind of move beyond just focusing on tactics or military strategy that has its role, but what are we fighting over? What is the purpose of this fight? And that letter from 1884, you know, look at the ways that reconstruction was sort of torn apart by that point in time. And you can see a family like the Davis's that are, you know, kind of asking what was the point of all of this? - Right, yeah. To me it's really, the crux of the book is about these families and their persistence. Like it's easy, I think, for some people to say, well, this is a story that's just showing the tragedy and the hardships. I was like, but actuality, this is about empowerment, persistence and dedication in the demands for their sacrifices, right? Because this is obviously as the false cause, as Adam Domby points out, and all this like lost cause myth, right? But that black families remain persistent. And as the book will disclose later on, they reach, at least one of the family members reaches the First Lady. Right? And they develop a relationship through these correspondences that I had not anticipated in the records. But to me, it was like, it was such a powerful story, right? That Eleanor Roosevelt, you know, is writing this woman, a woman who says outright, I'm a poor black woman from Philadelphia. I know you have The Great Depression and you've done so much for black people. Can you help me? And Eleanor responds. Repeatedly. Right? And that to me is about, she doesn't have to do that, but she is wanting, in my argument demanding, that you, and I say you as society, do not forget what we gave. Our family. - Sure, absolutely. This is wonderful. Thank you for sharing that with us. And, to just kind of wrap up here, the book that you're working on, it's sort of in progress still, it's tentatively titled \"The Family Civil War.\" It will be published through the University of Georgia Press. And you were saying probably about next summer, summer of '21. So just love to hear, you know, if people want to follow your progress and maybe on social media and what you're working on. Just maybe tell us a little bit about what we can do to learn more about your projects. - Yeah. Thank you. So I'm on Twitter. I think it's PhUsct or you can just find it through my name. I've been lucky enough to have an essay that's gonna be coming out with Adam Domby and Simon Lewis. That's gonna actually try to problematize what does it mean for African American soldiers who are serving during reconstruction from the North or liberators, and protecting the freedoms of formerly enslaved people, but in the process will lose their own freedom in a multitude of ways, which will lead to some big problems for their families. And I think that to me is what's important is that we understand the human component, the material realities for people, right? So that, what I'm hoping is that this pushes us, along with James G. Mendez, his work \"A Great Sacrifice,\" to recognize that families matter, right. And in a very important, and in some ways, you know, moving aspects, I'd say my hope is to my next book, will most likely be looking at Philadelphia's wartime mobilization. And, you know, I've got ideas for many other projects. My hope to all hope is that this becomes a movie, right? Like I'm trying to actually write a screenplay because the stories are so compelling. And I think there's so many that I didn't get to that could be, you know, Netflix miniseries or something. So if there is anyone out there listening that wants to move forward with that, I'm all ears. - Sure. Shoot for the stars, right? - Exactly. - Absolutely. Well, fantastic. Thank you, Dr. Holly Pinheiro, Jr. Thank you for being with us today. We look forward to reading your book when it comes out next year, and thank you for being on the show today. - Thank you very much.",

            "description": "Join the island's own Dr. Scott R. Santos as he uncovers the hidden secrets of Hawai`i’s most famous endemic shrimp, `opae `ula (Halocaridina rubra.) The anchialine habitats of Hawai`i are coastal features defined as \"pools with no surface connection to the sea, containing salt or brackish water, which fluctuates with the tides\" and are typically land-locked open pools and cracks like those found in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and along the Kona coast. Although these habitats have been documented in many places, the Hawaiian Islands have the single largest concentration of anchialine pools in the world (approximately 520). Unfortunately, many of these jewel-like pools have been modified or destroyed in the last 50 years either in the process of coastal development or by the introduction and spread of exotic species. Understanding the biology of wildlife inhabiting anchialine habitats is paramount to developing sound management and conservation plans for these unique ecosystems. Tonight, Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park unveils the newest Kilauea Visitor Center attraction - a living Anchialine Pool Exhibit featuring native Hawaiian shrimp.",

            "description": "In partnership with Southern Indian Health Council (SIHC), a social service agency that serves youth from seven Kumeyaay reservations in San Diego County, Cabrillo National Monument proudly hosted twelve students throughout the summer. Native STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) is the first Cabrillo program of its kind and comprises a unique blend of western science and indigenous practices. With activities such as storytelling, nature journaling, tidepool monitoring, and ethnobotany, youth ages 6-15 explored their cultural heritage within and beyond the park. Through innovative programs, such as Native STEAM, Cabrillo National Monument is committed to carrying out the mission of the National Park Service into our second century.",

            "transcript": "1 00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,040 Hello everyone, this is Ranger Katie, inviting  you to join us in observing National Park Week,   2 00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,160 from April 16 to April 24. During this  special week we celebrate the many ways   3 00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,240 that National Park sites enrich our lives  by connecting us with our environment,   4 00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,160 our history and each other. Each day this week  spotlights a different theme, an intangible way   5 00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,960 that National Park sites help us experience  and appreciate our nation and our world. 6 00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,680 On Monday April 18 we focus on the spirit of  “collaboration.” We can always get more done   7 00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,200 when we work together. We draw strength from  diverse life experiences and skills of others.   8 00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,880 In the National Parks, this idea of bringing  people together to achieve a goal is especially   9 00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:49,120 emphasized. Whether going on a hike, setting up a  camp or any of the countless activities available   10 00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,520 in National Parks, it’s easier, and more fun, if  others are there to help out. The National Park   11 00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,720 Service depends on partnerships to help with its  primary goal of protecting our most special places   12 00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,760 and making them enjoyable for visitors.  Friends’ groups, cooperating associations,   13 00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,840 concessioners and volunteers help fund  programs and provide services for our visitors. 14 00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,320 Here at Gateway Arch National Park, we tell the  stories of the people who were part of the grand   15 00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,240 epic of Westward Expansion, people who had to  collaborate to be successful. Right here in St.   16 00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,960 Louis the first French colonists formed a business  partnership with the Osage people that helped   17 00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,800 establish the city as the “Gateway to the West.”  Mountain men who had forged the first trails in   18 00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,480 the Rocky Mountains, led the pioneers to their  new homes in places like Oregon and California.   19 00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,640 In the early twentieth century, private groups and  local governments collaborated with the federal   20 00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,640 government to bring a National Park to St. Louis  and the soaring Gateway Arch to the riverfront. 21 00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,280 So, on this special day of “collaboration”  we encourage you to find your park.   22 00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,760 Reflect on collaborations you’ve formed to bring  about a rewarding experience in National Parks.   23 00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,480 Consider people and groups you  can collaborate with to sustain   24 00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,600 and protect these special places  for the enjoyment of everyone.",

            "transcript": "Hey guys. This is Ranger Jake Boling here with another virtual program from Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park. I'm standing a beautiful May day here in our open, in our front memorial field here at Kennesaw Mountain with the illustrious Kennesaw Mountain behind me. Today's program is going to be on Rocky Face Ridge which is the first real battle in opening actions of the Atlanta Campaign. Now, if you have paid attention to our upcoming event newsletters and kind of our things that we post online you may have seen in the details that we were hoping to have author and historian Robert Jenkins helping us do this presentation. Unfortunately, due to scheduling conflicts we were unable to kind of cinch that in and so today you're stuck with your favorite, Ranger Jake. So while I am not the subject matter expert that Mr. Jenkins is, I will do my best to give you a solid program and and talk about this really interesting battle. We do hope to work with Mr. Jenkins a little bit later on through the campaign. So stay tuned for that. So Rocky Face Ridge was not the biggest or bloodiest battle of the Atlanta Campaign by far, but it is a super interesting opening action for a lot of different reasons. Number one, it would foreshadow a lot of the things that would later happen and kind of the strategies both by Sherman and Johnston. Number two, it really highlights the mutual respect and kind of chess match that is going on between these men and that the Atlanta Campaign would be. And number three, there's a there's use of a lot of really interesting strategies. Um, there's use of, Johnston's use of geography is really highlighted here and so on. And and really there is a big what-if moment at the end of this battle that a lot of historians and folks that talk about this think that things would have gone a lot different had this battle changed and had a certain detail been different. So to to set the stage for you, after their defeat in the Battles of Chattanooga and Chickamauga, the Army of Tennessee under Bragg at the time, Braxton Bragg, has wintered in the north Georgia town of Dalton, just a tiny town just off, uh, several miles uh east of the Western Atlantic Railroad. So after Joseph Johnston takes control of that, he, um, he starts preparing, making his preparations for the Atlanta Campaign and his Army of Tennessee, which is about 44-ish thousand strong, is in the town of Dalton. Now between Dalton and the railroad, the Western Atlantic Railroad, is Rocky Face Ridge. Rocky Face Ridge is a huge --as the name you know details --a rocky ridge. It stands about 1500 feet at its highest point and it is a huge rock wall that is between the railroad and Dalton. Johnston knows. Again, we can't, when we talk about the Atlanta Campaign, we can't overstate the importance of that railroad to both sides. Johnston knows that when Sherman comes into Georgia in early May that he has got to stick to that railroad, and lucky for Johnston, that railroad cuts through Rocky Face Ridge and makes it a heavily, easily defendable position. And Johnston takes full advantage of this. So, you're going to see a map popping up on the screen right now of kind of the geography of, of that area. You're gonna see, kind of um, you see Rocky Face Ridge. You'll see where the railroad cuts through and you'll see where the town of Dalton is in relation to that. So you can kind of get an idea of what I'm talking about when we go through this. Now through Rocky Face Ridge, there are only three paths that any number of people can get through. Okay, there is the main path that goes along the railroad which is Mill Creek Gap. Okay, that is where the railroad passes through and while that's the biggest pass, it is still narrow, rocky and again easily defendable. Just south of that is the even smaller Dug Gap, okay. And 14 miles south of that, near the town of Resaca, is the tiny Snake Creek Gap that cuts through. These are the only three passes through Rocky Face Ridge. Sherman knows this. Johnston knows this. So to give an idea of some of that, you're going to see a picture now. It's a George Barnard picture, black and white picture of Buzzard's Roost which was kind of a high point just between Mill Creek Gap and um Dug Gap there. Or I'm sorry just around Dug Gap. That you can kind of see the terrain here and again, see how, what what these two men are working with. Johnston is using this to his advantage. He knows that Sherman is going to see this and he knows that this is a very easily defendable position. So what he does is, he takes his, the strongest of his forces. He takes Hood's corps and Hardy's corps. Hood on the Confederate right. Hardy just south of him and lines them up along Rocky Face Ridge, making this into an armed fortress. Okay, now knowing, again this is where that concept of a chess match comes in, knowing that Sherman will not be likely to try and attack and force his way through the gap there, he, he anticipates what Sherman is going to do. He anticipates that Sherman is going to try a flanking maneuver to the Confederate, to the far Confederate left and try to take advantage of Snake Creek Gap. So while Johnston's strength, main strength, is on the face of that at his heavily... at his easiest and most strongest defensive position, he has a few regiments that are put down there to keep eyes on Snake Creek Gap. Not only that, but he cuts pioneer roads, with the Pioneer corps, he cuts roads connecting Dalton, the towns of Dalton and Resaca, 14 miles of them. So that if he needs to reinforce that position, he can do so quickly. Or if he needs to retreat, he can do so quickly. And on top of all of this, when he gets word that Jefferson Davis, the president, is sending Polk's corps who's in Alabama to reinforce Johnston's position, Johnston's idea is that he's going to have Polk's corps shore up that Confederate left to really try and, you know, hedge all his bets. Now, we have an interesting quote to kind of, to kind of set the stage for what's going to happen. And this is from a Lieutenant in Kentucky, who is a Confederate, who's on the top of Rocky Face Ridge there. And this kind of again gives you an idea of the geography and kind of sets the stage and shows these men's connection to history, which is interesting. So Lieutenant Lot Young says, \"We indulged the hope and wondered whether Sherman would undertake to force the pass in Rocky Face Mountain through which the railroad and wagon road both ran. We thought of Leonidas and the Spartans and hoped for an opportunity to imitate and, if possible, eclipse that immortal event at Thermopylae. But not so, the wily Sherman, that old fox, was too cunning to be caught in that or any other trap.\" And that's exactly true. So Sherman, not being any dummy and knowing Johnston's strategy, when he comes around the corner and he sees what he's presented with. He does exactly that. That wily, old Sherman hedges his bets and does something that kind of akin to what happened here at Kennesaw Mountain. So starting on May 8th, Sherman starts demonstrations or fake attacks to, on the Confederate right and to just south of that, with Schofield's Army of the Ohio and, uh, Thomas's Army of the Cumberland. Starts demonstrations at Johnston's, at the, at the biggest part of his defensive position to distract from McPherson's Army of Tennessee, which just like Sherm... just like Johnston thought that he would do, is McPherson sweeping wide to the south to the Confederate left to take advantage of Snake Creek Gap. So I'm going to, you're going to see a battle map here that put together by the American Battlefield Trust. And you'll see some of those true positions. You'll see, of course, the red for the Confederates; the blue for the Union to give you an idea of these men's position. Now, McPherson and Resaca and Snake Creek Gap is not on that map because it's just south of that map, just at the bottom. So you're not going to see that. So on the 8th everything kicks off. We have demonstrations happening at the Confederate, at the far Confederate right and just south of that at Mill Creek Gap and Dug Gap. Okay, not a lot of casualties there but that's where the heaviest of the fighting is happening. Sherman is, uh, is sending men out there, sending heavy artillery. Johnston's men are having no problem defending that position. There's, and again we talk about interesting strategies, at one position where, uh, Mill Creek, is toward the center of the line, where it cuts west, the men or the Union are trying to push through. And what, what the Confederates do there is, actually the Pioneer Corps, actually uh dam up the river and flood that area. Okay, the um it makes it, again that's kind of an interesting strategy and it's fairly effective. Okay, not to mention the rest of the geography. So everything's kicking off. The demonstrations are happening. McPherson sweeps wide and cuts through Snake Creek Gap and makes it. Now, here's where this is a big deal. He makes it almost completely undetected and gets out of the gap on May 9th. And this is why this is such a key moment. Sherman is elated. He's quoted as saying, \"I've got Joe Johnston dead!\" All McPherson has to do is push. He pushes, he cuts the railroad off, because again the railroad, another railroad runs from connecting Dalton to Rasaca. He cuts the railroad off. He can surround Johnston's Army of Tennessee, cut him off from supplies. And the Atlanta Campaign could be over right now. Sherman is elated. BUT this is that moment that hysteria...historians, there's always a what-if moment and this is one of the biggest ones for the Atlanta Campaign. McPherson holds. And the reason he holds look good on paper. He sees the pioneer roads that Johnston has cut and he knows that Johnston's position could be easily reinforced. And he also begins getting shelled by Polk's artillery. And Polk's corps is now sitting there, which is 15 to 20,000 strong. And he gets spooked. He knows that if he pushes too hard and gets caught out in the open that he could be surrounded and his men would be overwhelmed. So he falls back to the entrance of Snake Creek Gap. Sherman was less than pleased and McPherson, he would kind of criticize McPherson for that until the end of his days even in his memoirs later on. McPherson holds his position at Snake Creek Gap and the fighting continues. Now, it's as again you know, it's not quite over yet. Johnston seeing...What Sherman then does over the next several days until around May 14th or so is starts reinforcing McPherson's position. Since McPherson was unable to cut off the Army of Tennessee, he begins to reinforce his position slowly. Johnston, seeing that his flank is being threatened and knowing that Polk's corps could be overwhelmed down there, makes an artful retreat. And I say an artful retreat in that he takes his men and quickly moves them down those pioneer roads and holes up in the town of Resaca in his prepare, pre-prepared works. This would be kind of foreshadowing for how many, most of the rest of the Atlanta Campaign would go. And then we get, shortly after, the Battle of Resaca, which we'll talk about in another program. So, as I mentioned at the start of this, okay, this was not the biggest, bloodiest battle of the Atlanta Campaign. But it really highlighted the chess match that this campaign was between Joseph Johnston and William Sherman. I hope you guys enjoyed this program. Please stay tuned for more. We're very excited to highlight some of these parts and these key parts of the Atlanta Campaign for you this summer. and again thank you for sticking around with us. We will see you next time at the mountain.",

            "transcript": "Tour Description The visitor center and museum occupy the former White Pass and Yukon Route train depot built at the height of the gold rush in 1898 and administration building built in 1900. They are physically connected in the back forming a combined c-shaped structure with a small entry breezeway creating the separation. The finishes and materials have been restored including honey-stained narrow plank wood floors, period wallpaper, and chain-hung half-dome chandeliers. This tour includes two main spaces totaling 4,000 square feet. The visitor center includes a theater, a map orientation room, and a ranger desk area with a junior ranger discovery corner. The museum exhibit area includes interactive displays, models, objects, and graphic panels. Map Room - size 28 by 23 feet In the center of the room is a large touchable topographic map. On the surrounding walls are large scale regional and national maps. Small bronze models of other national park service buildings are mounted on a small table next to support pillar. Chest-high wainscoting and wide horizontal plank paneling make up the interior walls. The entire space including the ceiling is painted white. Theater - size 28 by 23 feet Located at the back of the map room are two entry ways into the theater. Walnut stained wainscoting cover the walls. The floor is flat and carpeted. Large framed historic black and white photos are mounted on the walls above the wainscoting. The park film, Gold Fever: Race to the Klondike, is shown on a ten-foot wide screen. Ranger Desk Room - size 14 by 14 feet On the other end of the map room, down an 18-foot long hallway, is a large open room with an L-shaped ranger desk. In the corner of the room to your left as you exit the hallway is a Junior Ranger discovery area with a full-scale kid-figure cut out models with a historic street scene backdrop designed for taking photos of your family members taking the place of one of the kid’s faces. In the opposite corner is a 12 foot by 12 foot room that was the original train ticket booth. Large fabric back-lit banners hang in the space today depicting historical railroad photos. To the right of the ticket booth is a small cast iron coal stove. All the trim and wainscoting in this area is painted mint green. A faint monotone tan wallpaper with a floral pattern covers the walls to the ceiling. Continuing passed the wood stove on the right is another hallway leading to the restrooms, the breezeway, and exit to the museum. Breezeway - size 40 by 13 feet A wooden boardwalk separates the museum space from the visitor center. Walking to the left down the breezeway exits to 2nd street and passed four self-standing flat exhibit panels welcoming you to the site. Museum Room 1 - size 31 by 19 feet Immediately to your right, after entering the museum from the breezeway, is a 14 foot by 8 foot original bank vault with replica items from the gold rush era including gold bars and scales. Directly ahead are stairs to the park offices. To the left is the entrance to main exhibit area. The room has a 12-foot ceiling painted an off white, and includes dark stained wood wainscoting, tan painted walls, three windows, and an exit door. The room is divided into three exhibit areas by 8 foot tall curved display wall in the center of the room. The walls form a T. You are standing looking at the top of the T. On the curved wall displayed on the T is a large introductory panel on the epic journey to the gold fields with historic photos, and on your right a reader rail panel and a small representative model of the Klondike river with replica gold pan and gold nuggets. This area covers the Gold Discovery story. Passed the reader rail is an artifact display case with a shotgun, gold pan, and original hand written note. Turning to your left along the right side of the room are large graphic panels with title: Building Your Boat. On the left, toward the center of the room, is a replica wooden boat with seating and a TV monitor that shows original footage of stampeders rafting down the Klondike River. A small tactile map of the Klondike River is mounted to the wall. Past the boat toward the front of the room is new exhibit area entitled, At the Gold Fields, with an artifact display case with gold extracting tools including a gold pan, small pick-axe, candle holder, scale, and small wooden box. On the back wall are two additional large graphic panels with historic photos and a reader rail with additional historic photos. Behind the reader rail is a vertical 4-foot diameter wheel that you can spin to see your fate at the gold fields, most are unlucky. Turning back toward the museum entrance, on the opposite side of the curved display wall is a large painted mural. In front of the mural sitting on reader rail is a flip book containing modern Gold Rush collectibles. This area is entitled, An Epic Journey Lives On. Also on the reader rail is a music box and small TV monitor showing a silent Charlie Chaplin film. Additional vertical graphic panels are mounted on the exterior wall between two windows and cover how the gold rush changed Alaska forever. As you make your way to the back to the museum entrance, you pass a large TV monitor showing historic landscape photos next to the modern day images of the same location. Past that on your right is visitor comment station. Museum Room 2 - size 31 by 19 feet Room two is a replica of room one and is entered by walking through room one. This room is divided by an 8-foot curved display wall. The wall divides the room into two main exhibit areas. As you enter the room, on your immediate left is an artifact display case with replica trail supplies including snowshoes, coffee grinder, lantern, whiskey bottle, and a tobacco can. Passed the display case, further along the wall are exhibit panels, a flip book with historic photos, and wooden packing crates, a barrel and burlap sack. This area highlights two towns Dyea and Skagway, supply towns at the start of each of the two trails to the gold fields. Mounted on the wall above the exhibit panels is an historic wooden sign advertising native trading and packing services. Behind you on the display wall in the middle of the room is a large map showing two main routes to the Klondike from Seattle, Washington. A tactile version of the map is mounted on a reader rail. The rail also includes a flip book with historic photos and a pull-out drawer with historic photos. On either side of the large wall map are additional graphic panels with a title Beautiful but dangerous and Racing Time and Each Other. Making your way around the display wall to the other side of the room you encounter the Choose your trail exhibit with a map of the two historic routes and an angled reader rail with a tactile graphic showing elevation gains. Past this exhibit in the corner of the room is a display entitled Prepare for the Worst which highlights the ton of goods required to embark on either the Chilkoot or White Pass trails. Below the graphic panel, sits two jars on replica wooden crates one emitting the smell of sourdough bread and the other hooligan oil. Continuing on the back side of the dividing wall, the exhibit displays are divided into left and right sides. On the left side, exhibits cover the shorter but steeper Chilkoot Trail and on the right, on the curved dividing wall, are exhibits covering the dangerous lower but longer White Pass Trail. Each side finishes at the other end of the room and includes long reader rails with exhibit panels, tactile models, and flip cards. Following down the Chilkoot side, are tactile models of trail food including canned beans, dried meat and bread, contrasted with the native diet of dried fish and berries. A real coffee pot, grinder, and gold pans spill out of burlap sack that sit behind a reader rail. Historic photos from the trail are displayed on the large panels. Toward the end of the Chilkoot display, a life size scene of two male mannequin stampeders hiking up very steep ice stairs. The scene rises to the top of the 12-foot ceiling recreating a steep snow covered trail with white painted fiberglass to simulate the snow on a steep embankment. The stampeders are carrying wooden crates on their backs. A scaled tactile model of the entire scene sits on reader rail directly in front. A 12 foot tall (3.7 meter) ruler rises up the wall displaying the height of an avalanche that once buried stampeders alive. A stereoscope viewer showing two winter photos at the Chilkoot Pass sits on a reader rail. Also on the rail, a push button audio station that invites you to guess a variety of sounds. Going back to the White Pass side, a 3 foot high cast model of the thick mud and debris encountered on the trail sits behind reader rails. You are invited to put your foot in a special opening that simulates how far you would sink into the mud. Exhibit panels show historic photos of all the transportation methods used on the trail including horses, dogs, and later a train. A tactile model of train climbing around a mountain peak sits on a reader rail. At the end of the White Pass exhibit, a real horse skull is displayed in an acrylic case. Turning the corner around the display wall, you are directed back into room one.",

            "transcript": "[audio description] Against a black backdrop the National Park Service arrowhead logo stands above the words Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park. Against a dark gray backdrop are the words the 157th Commemoration of the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain: Command Decisions for the Assault on Cheatham Hill. Hello everyone! This is Ranger Kyle and I want to welcome you to our 157th anniversary of the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. I am in a wooded area with some earthworks behind me, some Union earthworks. And we are here at tour stop number six: the Sherman and George Thomas headquarters. This is the start of a couple trails. We have a five mile southern loop section which is a nice peaceful walk through the woods. We also, in terms of history, have the historical assault trail which is a half mile all the way to Cheatham Hill and that gives you a very very good idea of what the Union troops would be facing here on June 27th, 1864. But what's going on right here is we are actually in the vicinity of what would be George Thomas's headquarters; not too far from the Union main line and as I said, a half mile from the Confederate lines. So, General Sherman's headquarters would also be in this vicinity at a place called Signal Hill which if you go north about three quarters of a mile it will be right around there. So to understand WHY we are having this fight here on June 27th, 1864, we have to think of the Atlanta Campaign as a whole. So what happens is Sherman and the Union army have a two to one numerical advantage pretty much throughout this entire campaign. So Sherman uses that to his advantage. Johnston will set up a defensive line. Because Sherman is two on one numerical advantage he will constantly sweep either on his right or his left, outflank General Joseph Johnston and the Confederates. The problem with Sherman is is that every time he flanks him, he runs into more resistance. Johnston is usually just one step ahead. This Atlanta Campaign is truly a game of chess one way or the other. This leads to frustration for Sherman constantly doing this just keeps coming up short. So he even, on June 17th, will even consider launching a full frontal assault. Another thing that builds Sherman's frustration here is going to be the rain. Rain, when they get here on June 19th, it had been raining already for a week. It continues on raining. This bogs down the armies. It kind of just keeps them here in a holding position. Meanwhile while that's going on, Sherman's line, he feels like his line itself is thinning. Now keep in mind, Sherman has a two to one numerical advantage here. If Sherman feels like his line is thinning, what must General Joseph Johnson's line be feeling like? So, he feels like this is a perfect opportunity to launch an assault even though the Confederates have been here already for a week and a half and have built up their positions including that at Kennesaw Mountain. Sherman also wants to show that he is willing to attack. He has felt that he's become predictable and coming just feigning and attacking one of Johnson's flanks. So he wants to change things up a bit. A couple other reasons: The last two reasons are on the Eastern Theater with his buddy Grant, General Grant. We are stuck now at the siege of Petersburg which started only on June 16th. So Sherman is thinking maybe because of this Lincoln needs a victory. Remember we are in an election year. So any victory for the Union is a even greater chance for Lincoln to get reelected. One other thing is General John Logan actually thinks in his memoirs he'll write that he actually feels that because he sees Sherman's, sorry, sees Grant's name in a newspaper constantly because of battles at the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, Sherman feels like he needs a big victory, a big battle as well to kind of match with Grant. I mean, even today, we think of Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor. We don't really talk about the battles here at the Atlanta Campaign such as Resaca or even Kennesaw Mountain for that matter. They are overshadowed by what happens in the East. So, General Sherman finally decides June 24th he's going to send out an order called Special Field Orders No. 28. And what it will read is General James McPherson will be attacking near Burnt Hickory. He's also going to attack the northern line, of, the far left of the Union line attacking the Confederates far right. General Schofield is going to go not too far from here and attack the Powder Springs Road. So those two generals and their armies have been given commands of a certain point to attack. This is where Sherman now gives General George Thomas, the Commander of the Army of the Cumberland, some leeway. He gives Thomas, the \"Rock of Chickamauga\", his option of where to attack. He leaves it at his discretion. So, no commander, so once these orders are given out, Thomas, McPherson, Schofield, none of them really understand this. They've had all this success before flanking General Joseph Johnston. Why not continue it? Um, so no commander, none of these Schofield, McPherson or Thomas are going to agree with this. One of the Thomas' staff officers will actually ask why he doesn't protest. Thomas' reaction is, \"I have protested so often against such things that if I protest again, Sherman will think I don't want to fight.\" And that is a common theme in the Civil War where, or even any war. Like you do your job as a soldier. You will listen to your your commanding officer. And that's exactly what these men will do. So they're going to do what they do as good soldiers. They're going to figure out their plans of attack and go from there. On June 26th, General George Thomas is going to do a personal recon out towards the fields trying to figure out where in the area, in the center of the Confederate line, where it is best to attack. He's going to bring one of his aides with him named Captain Henry Stone. And Captain Henry Stone will say this: \"During the entire search of almost half a day I did not see one place that seemed to me to afford the slightest prospect of success. The place finally selected was chosen more because the lines were nearer each other than because the enemy's lines seemed vulnerable.\" So from where we are here, at General George Thomas' headquarters to where he decides to attack at Cheatham Hill, we're about a half mile in distance. Okay so the plan is now set. On June 27th, George Thomas will take five brigades, about eight to nine thousand soldiers, and will take them all across a mile long front and attack the Confederate position at Cheatham Hill. This plan also will involve some time. At Pigeon Hill, they...Now both of these fights, Pigeon Hill and Cheatham Hill are supposed to start at the exact same time. However, George Thomas is a little slow in getting things going. So at Pigeon Hill, the assault will start at 8:00 am. About an hour later, at 9:00 am, the men of the five brigades under George Thomas will step off the field marching towards the Confederate line. And in a later video, we will talk about what happens more specifically with those soldiers. But so now the gun smoke has cleared. Everything has finished. The Union has kind of dug down in front of the Confederate lines to where they can't be shot at. General Sherman will actually ask George Thomas if another attack is possible. And George Thomas will reply back to General Sherman with this: \"We have already lost heavily today without gaining any material advantage, one or two such assaults would use up this army.\" So after that, no assault would be taken on the following days.However, there is one success for the Union army on this assault. Further south, General John Schofield will actually have success in turning Johnston's flank thus forcing the Confederates on the night of July the first to leave his positions. After this, Sherman publicly will end up blaming others although his subordinates were against it. But Sherman would find no no blame on himself. So what we have coming up are a couple more videos about the fighting at Cheatham Hill. We will talk about the Union assault, as well as the Confederate defenses. Thank you everyone and have a good day! [audio description] Against a dark gray backdrop are the words Thank you for joining us for the 157th Battle of Kennesaw Mountain.

            "transcript": "Karen: Before I turn the phone line over to Joy Beasley to introduce Kate Birmingham, I wanted to say a few words about her involvement in the L'Hermitage Slave Village Project. Before moving to the regional headquarters where she's currently employed, Beasley served as the cultural resources program manager at Monocacy National Battlefields in Maryland. It's really to her that we owe our great debt for getting these projects off the ground. While she was there, she directed several very complex and high profile archeological projects, including the archeological discovery and investigation of the slave village. She was very successful in leveraging Park Service funding, and a large volunteer program to carry out several fascinating projects at Monocacy, including work at the Middle Ford Ferry Tavern on the Monocacy River, the Best Farm and the L'Hermitage Slave Village. If you have not had a chance to read any of the reports or discussions that have come out of this work, you really should. It's very - it's fascinating work. Thank you very much for being with us today, Joy. Someday you'll have to give a talk on some of your other research. Joy: Thank you, Karen. I appreciate the opportunity. Good afternoon, everybody. As Karen mentioned,] I'm Joy Beasley. I'm the Chief of Cultural Resources for the National Capital Region of the National Park Service. It's my pleasure today to have the opportunity to introduce Kate Birmingham. Kate came to work for me, back in 2009 as a newly minted - having just finished her graduate degree - and we were in the process of filling a term position for a person to be kind of the field director for this really important archeological investigation of a site that had been discovered way back in 2003, which was the site of the slave village associated – to find the right person to manage that whole project, really from field to finish. Kate came in for an interview, and immediately struck me as a very smart, and very capable young lady. She really hadn't ever ... She'd done a lot of very good work, but hadn't really ever been given the opportunity to manage a large and complex project. I immediately got the impression that she could handle it, and that she would do a great job. She just needed somebody who was willing to give her that opportunity. I can say with total confidence, that she completely exceeded my expectations. Her work was outstanding ... Her enthusiasm, her ability to work closely with the local community, with volunteers, with the many outstanding undergraduate and graduate student researchers, who were employed during the course of the project, her outstanding research skills, and just really, her great attitude. My only regret at this time was that we didn't have a permanent position to offer Kate, but fortunately, everything worked the way the term appointments are supposed to, and she was able to use all of the good experience, and work that she did at Monocacy, and parlay that into a permanent position, where she is now, as the Cultural Resource Manager at National Capital Parks East. She's done an outstanding job, and I really think that Kate's work associated with this project really, truly meets the definition of what the Cotter Award is intended to recognize; that's outstanding research in National Park Service archeology, that I think serves as a great example to the field, in general. I'm looking forward to seeing what Kate does next. With that, I will let her go ahead and tell you about this really great project. Thank you. Kate: Thanks for that great introduction, Joy. I really appreciate it. This was really, really a phenomenal project to begin my park service career with. It's just incredible, and I hope that you get an understanding of how lucky we were to be a part of this. I'm really honored to be the recipient of this year's Cotter Award, in the project category. Before I get too far, I'm going to bring in a plug. We just published the final report for this project this year. Actually, Karen mentioned earlier you can find all of the Monocacy projects here at NPS.gov/rap, which is the Regional Archeology Program webpage. You can request a copy of a pdf, or a hard copy of the report that you can read. They're processed really quickly. I'm probably a biased author, but it's a pretty great report that we're really, really proud of. The story is pretty complex. It's evolved over the last 16 or so years of research. It's a really complicated, interesting, and heartbreaking story that lends itself more to a historical soap opera, than a typical archeological assessment, so much so, that we're often asked to write popular books on the subject, rather than just the technical reports. The still-evolving story of L'Hermitage has revealed a very complex story of Vincendiere family, and it's allowed us to learn more about the enslaved population, who were forced to serve the family, the resistance while on the plantation, and their lives afterwards. I'll start by providing some information about Monocacy National Battlefield and the context for the initial overview and assessment, that led to the more recent research. Then I'll talk about the historical background on the Vincendiere family, and the establishment of the L'Hermitage Plantation, and the enslaved individuals that toiled there, then the archeological data uncovered from 2010 to 2012, and discussion of genealogical research about the descendants. I'll conclude with some final thoughts, and my recommendations for future investigation. Monocacy National Battlefield is located just to the south of Frederick, Maryland, in Frederick County, Maryland. It's 30-miles northwest of Washington, DC. It's a part of the National Capital Region. The park itself was established in 1934 to commemorate the Battle of Monocacy which was fought on July 9, 1864. The enabling legislation of the park is broad. It allows not just for the interpretation and preservation of the day of that battle, but also for the interpretation of the battle within the full context of the Civil War and American history. This is important, particularly for this research, because it lets us examine slavery as a cause of the Civil War. The park is made up of a total of 1,647 acres, and has 6 co-tenant farmsteads, which you can see here. It's dissected by Route 270 and Route 355, and Route 355 is historically known as the Georgetown Road. The Best farm, which is highlighted here in red, is one of the co-tenant farmsteads, and is referred to as the Best Farm after the name of the Civil War era tenant. The property was purchased by the National Park Service in 1993. Initial Section 110 studies of the farmstead were undertaken to assist with park planning measures. After the park was purchased, or this parcel was purchased, it wasn't open to the public. They wanted to open it for visitor access and construct a visitors center. The historical research and documentation began in the late 1990s. A multi-year archeological overview and assessment began in 2001. The most research, the identification and evaluation survey, took place from 2010 to 2012, and I'll discuss that in greater detail later on. I'll speak first about the history of the Vincendiere Family, to give you some broader concepts. From 1794 to 1827, the land that makes up the Best Farm was the southern 274 acres of a 748 acre plantation known as L'Hermitage. This plantation was purchased and run by the Vincendiere family, who were French planters from the Colony of Sant Domingue which is now known as Haiti. The family patriarch, Etienne Bellumeau de la Vincendiere was born in 1735 in Saint-Domingue. I'll make an aside for a minute - please forgive my French pronunciation. I never took French in school. I greatly regret it now. Etienne was a respected member of the military. He was a merchant and a planter, in Saint-Marc, and he served as an attorney. He also owned at least two coffee plantations. He can be seen down in the lower left hand corner of the slide. He relied heavily on his politically and socially well-connected relative Jean Payen de Boisneuf, who I'll refer to as Payen, and who you can see at the top left corner of the slide. He really relied on him for increased influence in the colonies. Payen owned three large sugar plantations and a house in Saint-Marc. He was also a member of the military, the Estate General of France in 1789, and the Colonial Assembly of Saint-Domingue. He had quite a lot of influence. One of Payen's contemporaries, referred to him as a \"gangrenous aristocrat.\" He was an interesting character. Etienne married a woman named Marguerite Elizabeth Pauline de Magnan, who I refer to as Magnan, in 1769. She was the daughter of very wealthy and influential indigo planters. Etienne and Magnan had 10 children, 7 of whom survived to adulthood. Of note, who we'll be talking about a lot is the eldest, unmarried daughter, Victoire. On this slide, her image is on the right hand side of Pauline and Adelaide. All four of these images we identified within the last 4 or so years. We're still looking for one of Victoire. If you ever see one, let us know. The entire economic viability of Saint-Domingue hinged entirely upon the practice of slavery. In 1789, the colony's population included 31,000 whites, 28,000 free blacks and 465,000 enslaved individuals, which is a number that's very, very likely much lower than it was because individuals under-reported the amount of enslaved labor they had, due to a tax on documented slaves. So the Vincendieres and their close family likely had an incredibly large enslaved population in the colony to run their multiple coffee plantations. According to 6 newspaper advertisements printed between 1771 and 1789, 7 enslaved laborers escaped Etienne's plantation, and several escaped from Payen. Some of the advertisements indicate that they branded these enslaved laborers. Some of the most brutal treatment of slaves in the world took place in this colony. Ten percent of plantation slaves died annually of overwork and poor treatment. The enslaved were viewed as tools, rather than humans, and were treated incredibly inhumanely. In part to that, due to that, and also just the general inhumanity of slavery, the slave insurrections began in the colony in 1791. They were very violent, and fast. In 1792, the revolts reached Etienne's plantation. He and his eldest daughter, Pauline, and her family fled to South Carolina. Magnan, Payen and the rest of the family were residing in France at this time. The younger Vincendiere children were being educated in Paris, before the onset of the French Revolution. Some sources indicate that Magnan and the children barely escaped the Reign of Terror. There are reports that indicate that they were hiding from farmstead to farmstead, being pursued by the Royalist Army or - sorry - the other army, because they were assisting a Catholic priest who was slated to be beheaded. They made it to the US sometime before 1793, although they very likely intended to return to Saint-Domingue before learning of the slave revolution. The family sent for or brought with them a total of 12 enslaved laborers from the colony. Due to the revolution, American officials were concerned that the enslaved from Saint-Domingue had seen or been part of the uprising, and would instigate similar revolutions in the US. As a reaction, the State of Maryland limited the number of slaves that could be imported. They laid out other restrictions, such as the nature of their service to owners, so with a preference to people who were personal servants, and also when they could be sold after they were imported to the United States. Etienne settled in Charleston, South Carolina, and the rest of the family, including Payen and a family friend, settled in Frederick, Maryland. It's not entirely clear why Etienne and Magnan established these separate households, although there is some evidence, due to the timing of the birth of the youngest daughter, Helene, that there was some bit of marital strife involved. The family settled in Frederick, Maryland, in some part, likely due to the Catholic parish there, St. John. They had a very close relationship with the priest, and other historical documents show that they had interesting financial entanglements with the church. The 748 acre plantation they purchased in Maryland was quite oddly placed under the name of Victoire, the eldest unmarried Vincendiere daughter. Some previous interpretations of this by other historians have inferred that it might've been because she was a really strong, powerful young woman. To me, it most likely seems that it was due to the incredible amount of debt that followed her elders from Saint-Domingue. The family assets in her name were extensive, and not confined to Maryland. It seems more likely that Payen and Magnan financed these. One reason for this is that debtors followed the family elders from the colony in France. Even though the colony was very lucrative, the plantation business was very fiercely competitive. Even when they were in the face of great profit, normally they would still spend what they had and more, and credit and loans were sought constantly to expand these operations to make more and more and more, money. They lost everything that they owned from the colony when they fled, except for their debts that followed them. Debtors, we can see, followed Payen into the States and he really did not want to pay anything. He wanted to keep living the lifestyle to which they were all accustomed. The letter pictured on the slide, was a great find that I had a couple years ago. It was really exciting, once we had it translated from French to English. In it, Victoire mentioned the expectation that her mother and Payen had had that they would get their land back, or at least get paid by France or Haiti for the lost assets. In 1825, Haiti finally agreed to pay France an indemnity, that really ended up crippling the Haitian government, and is still echoing in their economy today. It still did not amount to the funds that Victoire felt that they should get. In this letter, she expresses to her sister, Pauline, that they'd only broken even, after all the indemnities were awarded, and that was really disappointing to her. In this vein, and with the expansion of their plantation, the 1800 census showed that the family went from owning just 12 slaves when they got here in 1793, to owning 90 slaves in 1800. They became the second largest slave holder in Frederick County, second only to the man who operated an industrial operation. This is a really unusual number, especially for Maryland. This family wasn't growing staple crops, like tobacco or sugar, they were growing small grains as far as we know. Similar plantations growing small grains of a similar size would have only been employing maybe 5 to 10 enslaved individuals. They must've had some kind of compelling reason other than agriculture, to invest in this very sizable enslaved population. I'll get back to this a little later when I discuss the archeology. To fast forward a little bit in the Vincendiere timeline, Payen died in 1815, and as you can see from these advertisements, Victoire began trying to sell them immediately after in 1816. Her mother died in 1819, so she's still trying to sell the property, and then she starts selling large numbers of enslaved laborers to downsize the plantation. By 1820, the enslaved population here was down to 48 individuals. These sales included enslaved laborers that they had brought from Saint-Domingue. One example is a woman, Filete or Filele, who was brought with the family from Saint-Domingue when she was only 8 years old, so that clearly did not resonate with them, that there was this person who had been with them for all those years. In 1827, Victoire sold the plantation and moved to a townhouse very close to St. John's Church in Frederick with her sister, Adelaide. During the rest of her life and in her will, Victoire manumitted or freed the rest of the enslaved individuals. The Vincendieres constructed several buildings, that are actually still standing on the property at the Best Farm. The main house can be seen to the left, the stone barn at the far back, and the stone and log secondary structure towards the front of the photos. They all date to the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Particularly, on the interiors show distinct signs of French-Caribbean influence. I've taken you through a very quick history, and I'm going to jump now to the 2001 overview and assessment, mainly just because in the timeline this one point is really important in the amount of the archeological work. Upon looking at the size of the enslaved population, you know it was clear that the archeologists recognized that a large number of individuals would leave a very significant mark on the landscape. They did shovel testing towards the back and sides of the main house to locate slave quarters, since that's the typical area in the Chesapeake to find slave quarters. They did not find anything from those tests. A great breakthrough for this research was the discovery of a historic account, written by a man named Julian Niemcewicz. He was a Polish expatriate traveling on the Georgetown Road in 1798. The account reads: \"June 15, four miles from town we forded the river. On its banks one can see a row of wooden houses and one stone house with the upper storys painted white. This is the residence of a Frenchman called Payent who left San Domingo with a substantial sum and with it brought 2,000 or 3,000 acres of land and a few hundred Negros whom he treats with the greatest tyranny. One can see on the home farm instruments of torture, stocks, wooden horses, whips, etc. Two or 3 Negroes crippled with torture have brought legal action against him, but the matter has not yet been settled. This man is 60 years old, without children or relatives. He keeps an old French woman with two daughters, she in sweetness of humor, even surpasses him. This charming group has caused about 50 legal actions to be brought. They foam with rage, beat the Negroes, complain and fight with each other. In these ways does this man use his wealth, and comforts his life in its descent toward the grave.\" That's a pretty heavy account to read. While there are exaggerations, like about the size of the landholdings, the number of enslaved individuals, we can immediately recognize, after historic research, there are facts here. The archeological group conducted research on the existence of court cases, charges of slave cruelty, which is research that we've continued throughout the length of this project. In 1797, alone, Payen was indicted in 7 cases for \"unmercifully beating and whipping\" several enslaved individuals, including Cedric, Harry, Jerry, Abraham, Steven, Paul and George. Additionally, Victoire was cited with \"excessively, cruelly, and unmercifully beating \" her slave, Jenny. The court quashed all but one of these cases, but Payen and Victoire were held to reconiassances for several cases, meaning, not that they weren't guilty, but essentially saying that they would keep the peace and perhaps pay a fine. Several other cases were brought against them, including one where Payen was brought to trial for \"not providing sufficient meat and clothing for his slaves.\" For this, he was found guilty. It's incredible that in a slave state these cases were brought to court. That really generally didn't happen, especially in Maryland. The State of Maryland was very divided. The state served as the plaintiff and local citizens came forward as witnesses for the prosecution. It's unclear if these allegations were enhanced by the local community's disdain for the family. They were French, they were Catholic, which was not typical of the population of Frederick. The family had a habit for not paying their debts, because they were constantly waiting for a payment from Saint-Domingue, that they would never receive. They also just didn't fit in with the normal standard of slave holding in Maryland, as we can tell from this account. It's clear that the enslaved here were treated very cruelly and very publicly. The style of slavery practiced by the Vincendieres was characterized by openly acknowledged physical, sexual and mental abuse. It's most commonly associated with Antebellum slavery in the Deep South and the Caribbean, than it is with Maryland. Given their origins in San Domingue, it's quite likely that Payen and the Vincendieres have a different concept of appropriate treatment of enslaved laborers, which probably differed very greatly from accepted visible practice in Frederick County. Slavery in Maryland was not publicly flaunted in the same way as the Deep South, but instead it was practiced with great discretion. Frederick Douglas illustrates that point, pretty well. \"It is generally supposed that slavery, in the State of Maryland, exists in its mildest form, and that it is totally divested of those harsh and terrible peculiarities which mark and characterize the slave system, but there are certain secluded and out-of-the way places, where it can be indecent without shame, cruel without shuddering, and murderous without apprehension or fear of exposure.\" Maryland was a very divided State. In Frederick County, the population was pretty equally divided between slave owners to non-slave owners. In order to get along with neighbors, who were people that you lived next to, that you saw everyday, the practice was to sort of ignore the practice of slavery. You know, what goes on on your farm, stays on your farm. It really wasn't spoken of. I want to take a minute to underscore this point. During the work, we spoke to a lot of visitors, and it was very shocking to me and all of our crew, how many people used the fact that slavery is a spectrum, from those who were treated mildly, to those who were treated with great violence, to excuse the evil of slavery. It's used as an excuse to say it wasn't that bad. I very nearly included screen shots of comments that were made on newspaper articles published about the site. If you end up looking up the site, and look at some of those news articles, I encourage you to look at the comments. Some of the public opinions on slavery are very frightening, and, honestly, some of them are not anonymous, either. It's a very common thing, unfortunately. I want to indicate that while this is an extreme case from Maryland, it was very public. The account mentions instruments of torture visible from the main road. Instruments of torture were on numerous other plantations. They were physical and they were mental. No matter how nicely or poorly individuals are treated, they all lacked the basic human freedoms that we celebrate as Americans. This freedom was obviously valued by the enslaved generally, and the enslaved at L'Hermitage resisted forced servitude in many ways. Another question I often hear is \"Why didn't they just escape?\" That question tends to simplify the human condition in general. Primary references indicate that at least four individuals escaped or attempted escape from L'Hermitage. All these individuals took on great risk. Threats included capture, and then return. What your consequences were for that capture: the threat of physical abuse to your friends, your family and your loved ones that remained behind; the mental anguish and separation from community; and lifelong guilt and uncertainty about what might have happened behind you. Jerry, Cayou, George and Pierre-Louis all attempted to escape to freedom, despite these risks. I'm going to talk specifically about Pierre-Louis. We know what happened to Pierre-Louis after he escaped, from historic records. It's hard to trace for individuals. We don't know necessarily if they were captured or not. Pierre-Louis was a skilled wig maker, a musician and he was multi-lingual. After attempting escape, he was picked up as a vagrant in Philadelphia, and due to the Fugitive Slave Act was returned to L'Hermitage immediately. Pierre-Louis however, he was very resourceful and intelligent, and likely very well connected in the Frederick community. His attempts to gain freedom after his return didn't stop. Instead, he tried a different tactic. He tried the law. Although Maryland law declared that blacks were assumed to be slaves until proven otherwise, there was a loophole that was eventually made into a law in 1796 that allowed presumed slaves to petition for their freedom, and bear that burden of proof that they felt that they were being held illegally. Pierre-Louis actually petitioned for his freedom on the grounds that he had been Payen's brother's manservant, having never served Payen himself. Which was actually true, Pierre-Louis had originally been Payen's brother's manservant. His brother died while Payen was in France, and Payen sent for Pierre-Louis to serve him. Therefore, the court decided in Pierre-Louis' favor. After delays caused by Payen's appeals and refusals to bring Pierre-Louis to court, and he had to pay fines for that, in 1799, the state court upheld the earlier decision, and that made Pierre-Louis a free man. Although we haven't found much about his life after L'Hermitage, he did marry, it doesn't appear that he had any children, and he lived in Frederick City until 1820, at which time he disappears from the historic record. The enslaved also used outside networks to their advantage for resistance. Enslaved laborers were often involved in small-scale economic activities, and engaged in general daily communication with the community, and passersby. This advertisement taken out by Victoire, only underscores that they were creating networks that she disapproved of. This ad could have been related to her earlier legal troubles, it could have been due to Pierre-Louis' petition for freedom, or other escape efforts. No matter what, it's clear that she viewed the activities as problematic, and that the enslaved were actively seeking ways to resist the oppression and tyranny of life on the plantation, and that she felt like this would help her take matters into her own hands. I'm going to talk a bit about the archeology. Niemcewicz's account initially when it was found back in 2003 or 2004 provided really critical direction for the overview and assessment. The stone house and the upper stories painted white was an incredible clue, considering the main building complex was extant. The area between the structure and the road was not previously tested for a couple reasons. One, it wasn't a logical place to test for slave dwellings because in the Chesapeake, they're just not located to the front of the house, they're normally at the side or the rear. Also, the area was in a wheat cultivation area at the time of the survey, and the archeologists promised not to bother the farmer. Systematic metal detector survey was employed in the field between the structures and the road. This survey led to the identification of a dense deposit of late 18th to early 19th century domestic and architectural materials, over about 2/3 of an acre. The site was located on the back side of a slight slope next to a natural drainage. It was removed from the agricultural lease upon identification. Since all of this occurred at the end of the funding, for the overview and assessment, archeologists excavated two test units. Some of these revealed linear soil stains that were interpreted as a fenced enclosure feature. You can see them excavating that here, and see the aerial view of the feature. In 2010, we began the identification and evaluation survey of the site. We had the help of seven graduate and undergraduate student interns from local universities. We hired them with NPS youth intern program fund. Over the course of the work, we had over 50 volunteers, including undergraduate students and professors from Howard University. We had a ton of groups come to visit us. We also had a lot of support from the National Capital Region, Regional Archeology Program, and their interns. I want to note that I could go on for a very long time about how incredible this group was to work with, especially on this topic. Slavery is a very emotional and ever present topic, and very relevant. Some of these conversations that we were able to have were just so enlightening, and made me a better archeologist. We excavated nearly 200 shovel tests on a 20 foot interval grid across the site. Of those, we identified 20 as high potential for cultural activity, including these two, in which we found stone and mortar. This is incredibly exciting. I'll always remember the days that we found these. As archeologists in the Chesapeake region, we don't assume that we will find a stone or brick foundation component at all, due to the prevalence of earthfast structures, which are generally just post in ground. To find these was really great. To investigate these, we set out 5 foot by 5 foot, and 10 foot by 10 foot excavation units, in these high potential areas. Here is the area we refer to as Structure B, during early excavation. We identified that the stone and mortar was the base of an external \"C\" shaped chimney, which is located on the south end of the structure. Here's another view, the left of the drawing, the right is the aerial view of everything we excavated of Structure B. Two stone piers mark corners next to the hearth, and then we found piers along the northern elevation, and a western elevation. There was a large reddened soil feature identified on the interior of the hearth. There is only one chimney, making it quite likely that this was a barracks-style, single ben structure. Structure B exhibited pretty interesting characteristics. The enclosure feature that was identified during the earlier overview and assessment, as you can see here, lined up perfectly with the southern end of the structure. Additionally, the structure would have been fairly close to the original alignment of the Georgetown Road, meaning that the enslaved would have had a pretty interesting opportunity to converse with passersby. As the first field season progressed, we excavated three additional hearth foundations in units. The similarities between all these features were quite striking. They were all oriented in the same direction, and had the same construction with the exact same dimensions, which was 19' X 34'. We identified stone pier features with several of these structures. Some we didn't excavate extensively due to time. These were likely ... The piers were likely in place to provide a level surface for wood or logs for framing. The hearths were a measured distance apart, and that allowed us to hypothesize where more structures would be located. We're very proud to say that all of them ended up being located in test units that we had already laid out, for the most part. We discovered this fact, that they were all in line, on a day when our regional archeologist, Dr. Steven Potter, was onsite. It was just really, really incredible day. Through the use of excavation, and surface and ground penetrating radars, we confirmed the presence of 6 total structures. These buildings were clearly surveyed. They're clearly surveyed as to location, and hearths were exactly 66 feet apart, which is the equivalent of a surveyor's chain. They're oriented on nearly the same axis, within less than one degree of the extant structures on the plantation. They quite literally would have been a row of wooden houses. The construction illuminates several key factors about the visions the Vincendieres had of a plantation, and how that vision impacted the lives of the enslaved that lived here. The structures were built in a very precise and purposeful manner. What's really clear is that the Vincendieres wanted to create the image of a grand estate. What's more important, is that they chose this particular location for the purpose of surveillance. I'll add that to the side and rear of the house, there's perfectly flat topography where they could have placed a slave village, and chose not to. It's topographically situated, so that the area in front of the house is in full view of the main and secondary houses, as you can see from the view from this window. The Vincendieres manipulated the landscape very, very specifically so that they could closely monitor the enslaved individuals, exert their dominance and further oppress the enslaved population through constant surveillance. The landscape control could extend directly from practices typical in Saint-Domingue, or it could have been a direct result of the fear of the slave uprising, having had escaped one in Saint-Domingue. The positions of the hearth on the south elevation of the structure, is also puzzling. It would have ensured that the slave quarters did not have adequate protection from typical Maryland weather patterns. The location of the chimney is critical for adequate heating of the structures during winter months, when winds in the region blow from the northwest to the southeast. These quarters when the Vincendiere got here, likely would have been constructed first, since they would want to make the plantation productive through slave labor. Historic structures reports that were done on the main and secondary houses noted that there were inadequacies in the structures that were corrected. There were ceilings that were too high, there were windows that were built too large, and fireplaces that weren't deep enough or adequately located. In these houses, the deficiencies were corrected. In the main house, you can see the additions that the Vincendieres made. They had smaller windows, they had lower ceilings. The secondary house, they added a second chimney. They made the windows smaller. We have no archeological evidence that they were corrected within the slave quarters. If this is the case, this detail provides more evidence that the Vincendieres were not very concerned with the welfare of their enslaved laborers. We excavated a total of 49 units. Other archeological features were found. We found this midden, which was pretty fascinating. A lot of it showed evidence of demolition activity on the top. We also excavated an outdoor activity area, or kitchen area. We also investigated a anomalous stony knoll, that was located directly north of the slave village. Due to the presence of large boulders and copperheads, we utilized mechanical excavation to investigate this. What we found was a lime kiln, and it's of the type commonly employed on Maryland farms during the time period of the Vincendieres. In fact, several advertisements for the sale of the property, like the one shown here, indicate that it could've have been improved with lime. It's quite possible that the enslaved laborers here were employed, not only with growing small grains, and making the house functional, but also through the time consuming and very difficult process of gathering raw materials, processing materials, creating lime, and distributing the lime to local farms or factories. We recovered nearly 17,000 artifacts from these excavations, for these two years. The majority of these objects were architectural in nature, but we did find some really interesting patterns, or artifacts. One object was a carved oyster shell pendant, and that was likely made by one of the enslaved individuals. You can see that here, on the left. We also found 151 buttons. Mainly one piece, flat buttons, but some other interesting ones. We thought maybe this could reflect clothes- or quilt-making activities, potential laundering, however we haven't found any associated artifacts with those activities. The enslaved were largely consuming second cuts of meat. Cow and pig skeletons, likely reflecting on-site butchering. Marrow extraction and use of bones in stews. The enslaved also supplemented their diet with wild game and fauna. We found oyster shells, river mussel shells, and fish scales. The diet of the enslaved to me, is particularly interesting, considering that we know that Payen was found guilty at one point of not providing them with adequate food. We do still need a full faunal and dietary analysis for this collection. In my opinion, the most interesting fact about this assemblage is that it doesn't clearly indicate social status of the site's inhabitants. With the complexity of the story we definitely weren't sure what to expect of the material culture. What we found, which was high quantities of refined earthenware, a complete lack of locally made pipes and colono-ware. A majority presence of domesticated animals in the faunal assemblage, and a handful of coins and artifacts related to luxury goods. All these things made it really difficult to separate the material culture of this site from other plantation homes of middling planters in Maryland. It lacked some typical, what we call Africanisms that are often associated with enslaved populations. What I take out of this, and what I would emphasize is that, in addition to excavation, as archeologists we really have to develop a comprehensive history of our Antebellum sites to adequately identify these occupations of enslaved individuals within this region, given the diversity of the practice of slavery in the Chesapeake. The signature of enslaved life is pretty impossible to infer from material culture alone. I also sort of underscored this when I was doing my background research for the report, in that there was really a great lack of slave quarters identified in the archeological record of Maryland. Those that were, had a great amount of historic document research that often is not present on other sites. Just as we can't rely on material culture for all information about a site, we can't rely on traditional use of historical research to find all relevant data. One of the most interesting components of this research has been the genealogical component. This part came to us in a really untraditional way. As we'd been receiving a lot of national media coverage. During 2010, we were contacted by a writer for ESSENCE magazine. She wanted to know if we had identified a descendant community. Obviously, we were very interested and excited in doing that, but we personally lacked the expertise to conduct that. After several months, the magazine contacted us again, and dropped the bombshell that they had found a descendant, and they wanted to fly her out to the site. That was incredibly exciting. ESSENCE magazine used Afrogenus, specifically the work of certified genealogist, Michael Hait, to trace the family tree of John Murdock, a man who was manumitted in Victoire's will. From this research, ESSENCE learned that John and his wife were prosperous after and during the hardships at L'Hermitage. John could read the Bible and he was able to send his eldest daughter to private school. Cicely Schatzman, the descendant, was very moved by her visit, and stated that she wants to take any children that she may have to the site to keep the story alive. This was really incredible, and a connection that in many ways, a lot of archeologists don't get to make. We hired Michael Hait with some of our project funds, so that he could assist us in really doing more research regarding the enslaved individuals. His work is helping to reveal that the enslaved at L'Hermitage had incredibly different experiences. We get to see a little bit about what the remainder of their lives were like, how they and their children lived on through slavery, or through freedom. His work has shown us that some individuals and their descendants went on to own land, attend universities and have successful lives. Descendant Cornelius Ridgley served in the US Navy, then he re-enlisted to fight during the Civil War on the USS Minnesota. One of his grandchildren got a degree in landscape architecture from the University of Illinois, and a Masters in land design from Berkeley. He then worked for the NPS in South Dakota, and then he moved to DC to supervise the restoration of the Frederick Douglass Home in Anacostia. This fact really hits me now, that the Frederick Douglass Home is one of the sites that I had to work with. The park and the National Capital Region are currently working with Michael Hait, on a project to conduct Phase 2 genealogical investigation of the enslaved Vincendiere descendants. A significant component of this will be community outreach. I'm really excited for the results of that. We've also met with a descendant of the Vincendiere family, who is a civil rights lawyer. Just as the story of slavery didn't end at Appomattox Courthouse, the story of L'Hermitage does not end with the sale or manumission of the enslaved laborers. We want to look at L'Hermitage as just a part of their lives, and also learn how they and their families survived and overcame the difficulty of oppression. This story has a lot of facets, and it continues to build. Although myself and the other archeologists are no longer working at Monocacy, the park is dedicated to telling the story. They've installed a wayside about the slave village, which you can see here. They also plan on developing an interpretive trail and an exhibit. We had very, very successfully attended presentations, Joy and I, this summer at the Sesquicentennial Celebration. In terms of the archeological work, there's so much more to be investigated. I come up with new questions, all the time. It's like a form of torture, I think, since I can't do it anymore. The locations and nature of other outbuildings and structures on the site is of great interest to me. There's a great need to complete faunal and floral analysis and soil analysis, which could provide more data on what individuals were eating, what activities they were engaging in. We need more historical analysis of the lime kiln. An interesting avenue would be to look at the local iron and glass industrial complexes, to see if their archives provide information regarding where they purchased their lime. Here, I'll go back to my bookends, here. There's so much information within the technical report, I really hope that you are interested enough to get a copy, or the copies of the other reports from Monocacy. There's more detail in here, everything about the history, the excavations, artifact assemblage and the genealogy, which I don't have time for, but thank you to all the people listed here. Thank you everyone for listening. I guess if you have questions? Karen: Thank you, Kate. Are there questions or comments for Kate? Not yet? Well, I'll start with a couple of questions. Kate, is it your feeling, and the feeling of other people that are working on the project, that all of the slave population at Monocacy was housed in those cabins that you located? Kate: No, I don't believe so. Normally the enslaved individuals that would have been working in the house, would have been living in attic spaces, and basement spaces, above the out-kitchen. I don't believe the whole population would have been housed in the slave quarters. Karen: Is there any sense that these are family units? Kate: That's a great question. That's one avenue that without actual historical documentation, we can't really make a good distinction about. Some plantations that have barracks-style structures of this size and type would divide them by gender, rather than family units. It's really unclear, without any kind of further historical documentation about the plantation. It's very unlikely we could make that determination. Karen: Thanks for that. How many buildings do you think there were originally, or the Vincendiere plantation, altogether? Do you have any sense? You don't have records of other buildings besides the ones that are extant, and the ones that you've identified. Kate: There's actually a really good ad that we found, an advertisement, while we were writing this report, that has a pretty long list of the buildings on the property. This advertisement was from 1820 when Victoire was trying to sell the land. She states that it was beautifully situated on the Monocacy River. She lists the improvements, as a good two story stone house with six rooms, and a cellar, a stone barn, a stone stable, and that's a structure - the stable, burned at some point and portions of the foundation were excavated back during the overview and assessment. Actually finding this advertisement really helped illuminate that archeological find from earlier. They mentioned the secondary house, they say there was a granary, a pigeon house, a meat house, an ice house, a large well. They do note other structures. They note an orchard. Interestingly, in the advertisement, they do not mention the slave village. They seem to mention everything else. We know there was a lot there, but over the course of time, things have likely happened to those foundations. Karen: Do you think that the story of the Vincendiere plantation is kind of unique to Maryland? It sounds to me like within the context of Frederick and Frederick County, it was an anomalous social situation, in terms of the way that they had organized their physical space and the relationships that they had with their neighbors and the slave population. How does it fit into the social context of the Chesapeake Region as a whole? Kate: They were a complete and total outlier, I'm sure. We amongst the archeological team, and myself, we had tons of conversations about how odd they must have looked to everyone around them, and all their neighbors. I mean, that's why we sort of factor into our interpretation of the lawsuits. People brought suit against them because, you know, people probably just had no idea how to perceive these very strange characters that came from France, you know, devoutly Catholic, a broken family at that time period with scandal. Apparently, they always had other refugees coming to stay with them, so there was constantly a population of other French people coming and staying with them. The enslaved population, and how that looked to everyone, from how they were treated publicly. It's very different, in terms of having that kind of formal landscape on a plantation in Maryland at that time. Also very different from, like I said before, the size of the operation they had. The only individual that owned more enslaved persons than them, was somebody who operated a manufactory. They probably made everyone very, very nervous. Karen: It wasn't that they were part of a larger social network, elsewhere. They were truly outliers. Kate: I think that they were part of a larger social network of people they knew, certainly of Saint-Domingue refugees who ... It's definitely clear that they were communicating with them, because so many people were coming to stay with them. We do have evidence that they had a variety of individuals stay with them throughout the time when they sold the plantation. One woman who came to stay with them who was also a refugee, she went to New Orleans as a nun. There's actually a statue, her and another social aide worker, in New Orleans, that's pretty interesting. I definitely think that they kept their ties with people. I think they actively also sought to sever ties, particularly with the people to whom they owed money. Karen: Ah. How did they end up in Frederick? Kate: There's been a lot of questions about that. We don't really have a lot of evidence for why they ended up there, specifically. I tend to think it has to do with the earlier establishment of St. John's Church. The fact that they had a Catholic community there that was well established, that they clearly immediately were very involved with. Karen: Surely there were Catholic organizations in ... I don't know, in Baltimore, or Washington, DC? Kate: It wasn't as common back then, especially in Maryland to be sure. My personal thought is that they might have had a relationship with that particular priest already. Although I haven't done the research to establish that. Karen: I've sort of been monopolizing the conversation. Are there other comments or questions for Kate? Steven Potter: Karen, this is Stephen Potter from National Capital Region. Karen: Hi, Stephen! Stephen Potter: Just a couple of observations, to throw in. During this same period that these French expatriates wind up on the landscape, in the 1790s in Frederick, that's when the famous XYZ Affair under President John Adams occurred, where we almost went to world with Republican France. You've got to look at the international situation that went on at that time. This really put John Adams and Thomas Jefferson at odds with one another, because of course, Jefferson was very much a Francophile. You had Adams and his administration, you had Thomas Jefferson and his supporters, at each other's throats. Then you had this undeclared quasi-war between the United States and Republican France. That, on top of everything else that Kate has mentioned, is definitely coloring what's going on here, with the Vincendieres and L'Hermitage. Karen: Ah. Steven Potter: For what it's worth. Kate: There's also Payen himself. We have letters ... I mean, he wrote letters to every president that he could write to. He wrote to George Washington. He wrote to John Adams. He wrote to Thomas Jefferson, for all kinds of reasons. Mainly, to beg them to get involved with the slave revolution down in Haiti, so that he could get what he felt was his returned to him. Also, due to these larger issues that Steven mentioned. It was an incredibly complex time, particularly, too, with the Alien Sedition Acts, there was just so much that was going on. There was a lot of fear and hatred of the French at this time. Steven Potter: It's worth looking up, the XYZ Affair, and how that colored American politics at the time, particularly between the Federalists and John Adams, and the Jeffersonian Republicans, who were pro-French. It really ignited quite a fire storm here in the United States. Karen: I'll have to do some reading. Did you have another comment that you wanted to make, Stephen? No, OK. I have another comment, another question. Kate, you were talking about the fact that you didn't see a lot of social differentiation in the archeological materials from the slave village. Have I lost you? Kate: No, I'm here. Karen: I was wondering if it would be because if all of the enslaved people were coming from another cultural context, that they wouldn't have local connections. Do you know where the other 78 enslaved people came from? Were they American born or were they also coming from the Caribbean? Kate: We don't know. The slave census records for Frederick County are very sparse. They do not have a lot of information. Unfortunately, that's one of the problems with doing research on a slave community. Oftentimes, you find a dearth of research. That's one of the reasons, Michael Hait, the genealogist that we're working with, he is really not just looking at the genealogy. In order to really do his job, he also has to go back. He's been helping us to illuminate what we can about the enslaved individuals, and their origins, as well. It's just that it's a very difficult record to follow. That's one of the reasons a lot of people ask me about religious activities, and if we found religious artifacts of any kind. I'm very hesitant to make those associations, with any kinds of artifacts. We don't really know the specific origins of the individuals. Normally, the best religious interpretation of enslaved individuals, and artifacts, is made when you have a really defined context for where those individuals originated. We just don't have that. Even the individuals that came from Saint-Domingue ... The runaway advertisement for Pierre-Louis indicates that he was multi-lingual, and that his French wasn't even that great. He clearly was not a native French speaker. That lends the question of \"where was he from?\" Even the individuals that they brought with them from Saint-Domingue could have been from numerous other places. We have no evidence as to where that might be. Karen: I think one of the best examples of the examination of religious preference is actually from the African burial ground study that was done in New York City. Kate: Right, we unfortunately, lack a lot of that, further contextual information about the population, to make those kinds of determinations. I also say that, saying that we didn't find any subsurface features with caches or anything of the kind, no clear archeological features that would show that kind of activity, either. Karen: How interesting. Joy: Karen, this is Joy. I think that, just sort of a comment or sort of tiering off of some of what ya'll are talking about, I think that one of the things that would be really exciting going forward, is to see if we continue with the next phase of the descendant community research, what kind of new context or dimension that gives us about who these folks were. If there are folks out there that have information in their family histories, or in their oral traditions or so forth, that may help us be able to get at some of these ... The kind of information or context which is absent from either the archeological or the historical record. Karen: Absolutely, that should be very exciting, if you're able to dig up any of that information. Joy: Yeah, I mean if nothing else, we're excited to have the opportunity to share the results of our research with this descendant community that's out there. There's just no telling what opportunity that's going to present for us.",

            "transcript": "[00:00:15:08 - 00:00:48:22] Hi, friends. I'm Ranger Steve at Valley Forge National Historical Park. The third winter encampment of the Continental Army during the American Revolution. This was a very difficult winter for these soldiers. The encampment was a sea of mud covered in roughly 2000 log huts, much like the one that we're sitting in. They were burning green wood, which produces a lot of smoke. [00:00:48:51 - 00:01:26:31] Soldiers wrote that it would sting your eyes. Much of what we know about this encampment is because of the writings of the people who were here, the people who lived through the history. Many of them suffered. And oftentimes they used writing to work through the feelings that they felt here at Valley Forge. A young woman near the encampment named Elizabeth Drinker who had fled the city of Philadelphia when the British captured it, wrote in her diary in January. [00:01:26:31 - 00:01:49:43] \"The British troops have been out these two days foraging. It is amazing to see the great quantity of hay they have brought in. 70-odd loads, I am told they have taken from Abel James. What will they do when the present supply is gone? Large as it seems, I am told it will last but a little time. They used 'tis said 24 tons per day.\" [00:01:51:16 - 00:02:24:59] She used a little bit of math here, but it implies to a lot of math that the British were using, and the American army, in supplying their forces, supplying their people in camp to keep them fed. Sergeant James McMichael wrote a poem in his diary, one of his last diary entries. This poem was a farewell to his diary, and he wrote: “Farewell my journal, we must part, which contains some nature but no art.” [00:02:25:42 - 00:02:42:58] “The companion of my sore fatigues throughout the war, but not intrigues. Therefore, adieu my ambiguous book. May you be pleasing to those who in you look.” It's a short poem, but I like it. It illustrates how important his journal was to him. [00:02:46:14 - 00:03:12:06] When you experience hard times, how do you find the strength to keep going? Do you create something? Do you work to solve a problem? Do you take the time and space that you need to rest? Write about a time that you or someone else you know, experienced something difficult and how they persevered to move past the challenging situation. [00:03:13:20 - 00:03:42:49] Please send your stories to us here at Valley Forge National Historical Park via Facebook message, email, or snail mail. We look forward to seeing the stories that you share with us how writing has helped you persevere through difficult times. [00:03:46:39 - 00:03:49:43] I hope to see you out in the park.",

            "transcript": "Fillers worked in two 12-hour shifts to cover the 24-hour-a-day operations of the blast furnace. The furnace was always kept full when it was in blast. A blast was from the time the furnace was started up until its fire was put out. The heat in the furnace was so intense that after 10-15 months, the furnace shut down when its sandstone lining started to burn through. After each blast, this lining had to be replaced. A blast might also be stopped if a furnace ran out of charcoal, ran out of water to turn the water wheel, or if the water wheel accumulated so much ice that is could not turn properly. Hopewell’s longest blast lasted 15 months, from January 3, 1836 to April 10, 1837. The furnace normally took 48 charges a day, one charge every half hour. A charge consisted of approximately 15 bushels of charcoal, 400 to 500 pounds of iron ore and 30 to 40 pounds of limestone. The melted limestone called flux, combined with the impurities in the iron ore to make a waste product called slag.",

            "transcript": "[A woman on a video call.] EMMA SILVERMAN: So I know I've been talking for a while. I want to get us underway into this great discussion that's already going on in the chat. So I'm going to invite Bill to kick us off. Bill, can you tell us about Independence National Historical Park's response to the graffiti in terms both of a removal but also the way that you are interpreting the history of the monument and the history of George Washington? [Bill Caughlan loads a presentation.] BILL CAUGHLAN: All right. I'm going to be share-- trying to share my screen. Hi, everybody. Thanks for coming. Bear with me. [His image now in the upper right hand corner. A Park Ranger hat as the wallpaper. In a video window, a statue of George Washington.] [Text: Independence National Historic Park.] [The Lives of Monuments: Tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary War Soldier, Thursday, June 17, 2021, 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM.] BILL CAUGHLAN: OK. Can folks see the screen? OK. [Inscription behind the statue of George Washington and the eternal flame: \"Freedom is a light for which many men have died in darkness in unmarked graves.\"] [Within this square lie thousands of unknown soldiers of Washington's Army who died of wounds and sickness during the Revolutionary War. \"The independence and liberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts of common dangers sufferings and success.\" Washington's Farewell Address, 1796.] [Images of ceremonies over the years.] BILL CAUGHLAN: Yeah, for decades, everyone, the Tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary War soldier has often been a place of veneration, a place where local officials, veterans groups, visitors have come to pay their respects to those who sacrificed to bring about independence and the creation of the Republic that is the United States of America. But that changed in the late spring of 2020 while Black Lives Matter protests were going on throughout the city. At that point, the memorial was defaced. On it was spray-painted the words, \"committed genocide.\" [The words \"Committed GENOCIDE\" spray painted on the monument. A barrier of metal fences, each with a sign.] On a physical level, this act presented great challenges to the National Park Service staff in charge of the preservation of the resources at Independence National Historical Park. But this act, also widely and sometimes vehemently condemned, caused the staff at Independence to look inward and to think again about how we interpret the resources and our care. Resources that help to tell the story of the founding of the United States, which is a big part of this Park's mission. [A map of Washington Square displays the location of several historical buildings.] A little background. The Tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary War Soldier is located within Washington Square. I don't know if this laser pointer thing works. But it's a 6.5-acre plot of land located in the Southwest corner of Independence National Historical Park, cater-cornered from Independence Square. So here you can see Independence Hall, Washington Square's cater-corner. There you can see the tomb right in the middle of that spot. [The cursor moves to a location on a faded paper map of Philadelphia.] Washington Square itself is as old as the City of Philadelphia, originally called Southeast Square due to its location. It was one of five open spaces that Pennsylvania founder William Penn wanted to include in his plans for a Green Country Town as he called it. For more than 100 years, it primarily served as pasture land and as a Potter's Field or burial ground for those Philadelphians considered undesirable i.e. the poor, suicide victims, executed criminals, Catholics, Native American Indians, and both free and enslaved Africans. During the War for Independence, it served as a burial ground for soldiers, both American and British, who had perished as a result of the battles of Princeton, Trenton, Brandywine, and Germantown. And, again, during the British occupation of Philadelphia the winter of '77, '78. [On another map of the area the cursor highlights Southeast Square next to 6th Street.] The last bodies to be buried in Southeast Square were the victims of Philadelphia's yellow fever epidemic of 1794. Burials ceased as it was reported, quote, \"there were so many burials in Potter's Field that no more could be made without disturbing the remains of those previously interred.\" It's a lot of people. But I will say no one knows the exact number of burials in this square. It's in the thousands. But soon after 1794, Southeast Square became a public park and promenade. In 1816, it was proposed in Philadelphia City Council that all of the city squares be renamed in honor of prominent citizens. [Another map features Washington Square near the center.] It was at that time that Southeast Square became Washington Square, named for Philadelphia's temporary resident, George Washington, who, you may know, lived in this city while serving as the nation's first President. [A fountain, flags at both sides of a walkway, and monument in a black and white. Illustration. Text: Study of Memorial to Unknown Soldiers in the Continental Army, Washington Square, Philadelphia.] And now we fast forward to the 1950s. As a part of a redesign of Washington Square, a group of local businessmen decided to fund a memorial to the Unknown Revolutionary War Soldier. It was also decided at that time to include a long planned monument to George Washington... [Green trees behind the memorial and statue.] ...designed by architect G. Edwin Brumbaugh and dedicated in 1957. The memorial consists of a bronze replica of Jean-Antoine Houdon's standing figure of Washington placed on top of a granite pedestal. Beneath that is a marble sarcophagus that holds the remains of an unknown Revolutionary War soldier exhumed from the Square. The lid of the sarcophagus is inscribed with the words, \"Beneath this stone rests the soldier of Washington's army, who died to give you liberty.\" All of this is backed by a limestone wall with numerous inscriptions. The most prominent being, \"Freedom is a light for which many men have died in darkness.\" A propane-fueled eternal flame was dedicated in 1976 for the bicentennial. And then another part of the memorial is two rows of flagpoles that flank the Bluestone Walk leading up to the monument itself. Each pole flies a battle flag. A flag from each of the original 13 states, as well as the first American flag. [Scenes from various ceremonies.] Throughout the years, the monument's been a place of commemoration. Wreath-laying ceremonies occur on Memorial Day, typically, Veterans Day, and Washington's birthday. That was from last year's commemoration. Though Washington's birthday is the only ceremony that actually honors George Washington, the rest-- For the most part, as the memorial suggests, the focus is mainly on the Unknown Soldier and the sacrifice that he and others made to help bring about a nation free and independent. [The black and white illustration of the memorial.] This memorial, like many in the 1950s, is very celebratory. It was created at the height of the Cold War, when we as a nation were trying to illuminate the ideological contrast between American democracy and communism. And even now, with the Cold War being all but over, it still is a place that many come to contemplate the sacrifices made in the name of freedom. [The image of the words \"Committed GENOCIDE\" on the Memorial.] But as the graffiti suggests, not all agree that these freedoms in the United States are shared. Not everyone shares in the celebratory telling of this nation's founding. But we do not know exactly to whom the vandal is referring when they spray-painted \"committed genocide,\" we can assume that it was directed at George Washington and not the Unknown Soldier. Figuring out what group that Washington allegedly committed genocide against, it's a bit difficult to decipher. Though we can assume that it was either against Africans-- after all it was vandalized during Black Lives Matter unrest --- or Native Americans. Considering the fact that Washington oversaw the enslavement of over 570 Africans at his home at Mount Vernon from the time he took possession of the property until his death and that he refused to use his influence to bring about the end of slavery during his lifetime. As well as the fact that during his life, he participated in and sometimes spearheaded the removal of Native Americans from their tribal homelands as far back as the French and Indian War, all the way up through his Presidency. It then might be easy for someone to come to the conclusion that Washington engaged in practices that led to the destruction of nations, cultures, and ethnicities. Even if this was not his intention, his actions have led some to accuse George Washington of engaging in genocide. With this in mind, and granted some of it is speculative, the staff at Independence had to face some questions and challenges in terms of upholding our mission of preservation. [The graffiti.] First, there's deciding what to do about the defacement of the memorial itself. Cultural resource management, they're the division that takes care of preserving the physical items within the park, had to document the vandalism. Then they needed to figure out how to remove the graffiti. [Next to the graffiti on the ladder, a worker in a yellow vest.] We had lots of offers from people to come and clean it off, but this required the work of professional conservators. The wall of the memorial is made a very soft, porous limestone. Some of the paint became embedded and needed special solvent that would sink into the stone. [The paint, partially removed.] It took many weeks, but the graffiti is virtually gone now. [The memorial without the graffiti.] While we understand the anger that some people felt about this act of vandalism, we also know that for some time, huge chunks of our nation's history has been left out of National Park Service interpretation. For the National Park Service interpretation is preservation. Our job is to interpret these sites to inspire people to want to support the mission of preservation that the NPS is engaged in. In order to do this, we need the American public to know why these places, these memorials, and these stories they tell are important. But if we don't tell the whole story, then we won't get the whole of the American people to support us. That and it's the right thing to do. We as a park and an agency have expanded many of the stories we tell to include people of different genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, and nationalities. But I know from personal experience, we have a lot more work to do. We're not there yet, but I think we're headed in the right direction.",

            "transcript": "Hi folks! Welcome to the hold of the C.A. Thayer. Built originally in Fairhaven, California, and made almost entirely of Douglas-fir, Thayer sailed from the shipyards of H.D. Bendixsen in July of 1895, joining the Pacific Coast maritime trade as a sailing schooner for the lumber industry. Today, I want to share with you something that you can't see every day - Thayer's knees. Knees are a common form of bracing used in shipbuilding, so why I think Thayer's knees are noteworthy is because they aren't sawn or bent to shape but grown. Wood as a building material is not uniformly strong - it's strongest when the load is compressed along with the grain. So finding that natural long grain made for a stronger, sturdier knee. Now knees - grown knees - would have been taken from where that angulature is exhibited in trees, such as near the root systems of larger, mature trees or along larger, lower branches and their intersection with the trunk. What we have in the fore of the ship are white, painted knees. By the time Thayer was converted to a cod fishermen they would have put a temporary bulkhead to divide the hold, and the floor of the hold would have been used as sleeping quarters for the fishermen while the rest of the hold would have held up to 700,000 pounds of salted fish. It's quite the smell. The crew of the ship would have slept in a deckhouse in the forward part of the main deck, and the captain and his mates in a cabin in the stern of the ship. Every day we learn more about C.A. Thayer and our other historic vessels. I hope you'll come explore them with us at San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. Thanks for watching.",

            "transcript": "This is Superintendent Mel Poole. I'd like to welcome you to Catoctin Mountain Park, over 5,800 acres in the Blue Ridge geologic region of the Appalachian Mountains. When the federal government acquired this area in 1935, the ten thousand acres surrounding this was a clear-cut forest. Under management of the National Park Service since 1936, the southern portion of the park was transferred to the state of Maryland and became Cunningham Falls State Park in 1954. Since then, both parks have allowed their areas to naturally regenerate into excellent examples of mature deciduous forests. As you hike the Falls Nature Trail from the National Park to the State Park, imagine what it must have been like to walk this path in 1935, when the area didn't have a tree taller than a fence post. Enjoy what nature has provided us here, and thank you for taking the time to experience your America. Welcome to Catoctin Mountain Park. You're listening to the Falls Nature Trail podcast. This program describes some of the plants, animals and natural features you may encounter on the 1.4 mile hike through Catoctin Mountain Park to Cunningham Falls State Park. It ends with a history and explanation of the formation of Cunningham Falls, the largest cascading waterfall in Maryland. The trail is moderate, but rocky and steep at times, so sturdy shoes are recommended. Be aware that to enter the State Park, you'll cross Route 77, which is a busy road with many blind spots for drivers and pedestrians. Cunningham Falls State Park does not allow pets in the falls or lake area. You will see the boardwalk path that leads to Cunningham Falls immediately after crossing the road. To get started, the trailhead is located on the right hand side at the end of the gravel parking lot across Park Central Road from the visitor center. Catoctin Mountain Park encompasses 5,810 acres of forested ecosystem. Over 280 species of animals and over 750 species of vascular plants make this area their home. The spring is breeding time for many living things and is the perfect time to see animals and flowering plants. The days are getting longer, there's ample food to go around for all the wildlife and the air is pungent with fresh smells. Among the animals you may see along the trail, are squirrels, deer, salamanders, birds, skinks, eastern cottontail rabbits, snakes, and if you are very lucky, black bear. Squirrels and chipmunks are the most commonly see animals. Eastern chipmunks have distinctive black, white, red and tan markings of stripes and spots. These markings camouflage them as they live and scavenge on the forest floor. You will often see them darting in and out of crevices in logs and rocks, seeming as though they are curious about passersby. They collect nuts, seeds, berries and other foods and transport them using large pouches in their cheeks to a food cache located in an underground burrow. These cheek patches can expand to three times the size of their heads and are useful, not only for foraging, but also for transporting dirt away from the outside of their burrows. Removing dirt piles helps to hide the evidence of chipmunk homes from predators. In the same genetic families as chipmunks, squirrels are often seen performing acrobatics in an under the tree tops using their bushy tails for balance. They are scatter hoarders collecting food and burying it in different places to come back to. There are four species of squirrels in Catoctin's Mountain's forests. The eastern gray squirrel, which you may also see in your neighborhood, is the most common. They range from gray to tan gray and even black. Legend has it that during the Presidency of Teddy Roosevelt, 18 black squirrels from Canada were released at the National Zoo in Washington D.C. to help restore the dwindling grey squirrel population. Black squirrels are now a relatively common sighting, showing the efficiency of natural selection at work. Red squirrels are named for their reddish coloring. They are medium size with white bellies. They tend to be very territorial, commonly chasing other animals away from their immediate area. The fox squirrel has grayish-tan to reddish-brown coloring About the size of a small house cat, they're the largest squirrel species in the park. Fox squirrels are sometimes mistaken for grey squirrels when they are smaller, but their coppery-brown underbelly set them apart from their white-bellied relatives. Evolutionists consider fox squirrels to be living fossils with the skeletal system closest to that at the earliest known squirrel who dates back to 23 million years ago. The most elusive squirrel, the flying squirrel, sleeps during the day and doesn't actually fly. Skin flaps between their front and hind limbs help them glide long distances from tree to tree. Large eyes help them see in the dark. At about the same size as a chipmunk, they are the smallest squirrel species in the park. While it's very unlikely that you'll see one, it is common to hear them making scratching noises at night as they land on trees. The foraging and feeding behaviors of squirrels and chipmunks contribute to forest succession as forgotten caches allow for new generations of trees and other plants to sprout from the buried and overlooked seeds. The Falls Nature Trail is rocky in places providing good habitat for several species of reptiles. The five-lined skink, one of the most common lizards in the eastern United States, may be seen in your peripheral view slipping in between and under rocks. If you're quick, you may be able to see its whole body. They are brown to black with five light colored lines running from the tips of their noses to the ends of their bright blue tails. All reptiles are cold-blooded animals. Because of this, they have to use their environment to regulate their body temperature, basking in the sun or hiding in cool spaces to raise or lower their temperature. Spring is an especially great time to see these little guys coming out of their winter dormancy soaking up energy from the sun and looking for food for their hungry bellies. Snake habitat includes rocky slopes, loose rock walls, stream areas and abandoned buildings or wood piles. The copperhead and the timber rattlesnake are the only venomous snakes found in the park. They differ in appearance from other snakes in the area in that they have thin necks and triangular heads. The copperhead is tan with light and dark brown hourglass-shaped banding. These markings make it well camouflaged on the forest floor. It is primarily a night stalker and is seldom seen during the day. The timber rattlesnake can range in color from yellowish-brown to black with irregular black bands or diamond-shaped blotches. At the tail end, is the rattler, the source of the characteristic high-frequency hissing sound that can be heard when the snake feels threatened. The rattle is a series of nested hollow beads that are actually modified scales. These rattles grow longer every time the snakes shed their skin. The primary food of these and other larger snakes is rodents, but birds, insects and the occasional frog or lizard help diversify the menu. It is extremely unlikely that you will come across either species of poisonous snake found in the park, but if you do, leave it where it is and don't harm it. These snakes are normally not aggressive and won't bite unless they feel threatened. All of the animals in Catoctin Mountain Park are integral parts of the forest ecosystem and are protected by the National Park Service. More common snakes are plaid or lined garter snakes, black rat sinks and tiny delicate ring-necked snakes. As a general rule, snakes are very timid and shy and will do their best to stay out of your way. Because of their quiet nature, snakes are not commonly seen by the average hiker. If you're fortunate enough to catch sight of one, you are among a special few. All of the hibernators of the forest are coming out of their nests and dens hungry and ready for sunshine. The most well known of these, although not a true hibernator, is the bear. In the nineteen nineties, the largest animal in Maryland, the black bear, returned to Catoctin after a 20 year absence. Adults typically weigh between 100 and 400 pounds. Their color varies from cinnamon brown to black. They have good eyesight and hearing, but rely heavily on their excellent sense of smell to locate food. Black bears are not generally considered to be predatory, preferring mainly berries, acorns, hickory nuts, grasses and insects, but they will eat fish, carrion and some small mammals when available. Bears are thought to have the best sense of smell of all the animals on earth. To put this into perspective, dogs have excellent senses of smell, 100 times that of a human, but a bear's sense of smell is 2,100 times better than a human's. Most black bears can smell food upwind from twenty miles away. Bears tend to be wary of humans and will often flee when they sense your approach. In the spring, it's possible to see a mother bear with her cubs. Black bear females birth their cubs during the winter while they're hibernating. The babies, usually one to three in a litter, are hairless and only about the size of a kitten when they're born. Because they are so vulnerable at first, being born during hibernation gives them a few months to become better able to take care of themselves by hiding or climbing up a tree. When the family emerges from the den in late March or April, the cubs have reached about 10 pounds and are roly poly bundles of fur bouncing around looking for fun. They will grow rapidly, gaining roughly ten to fifteen pounds a month depending upon how healthy and well fed they are. If you see a cub, it may be curious about you and seemingly harmless, but the mother is probably close by for protection. Bear cubs stay with their mothers for about a year and a half separating at seventeen months when the cub is considered a subadult. Most female subadults will settle within a mile of, or within their mother's territory. Males will travel much farther, sometimes as much as a hundred miles away. Most cases of aggression from black bears towards humans are in defense of their cubs. Remember, that they are wild and should never be fed or harassed. If you encounter a bear, stay calm, do not approach it or run away. Avoid direct eye contact and don't panic if the bear stands on its hind legs. They do this to assess their surroundings. Remain upright, back away slowly and leave the area. Black bears very rarely charge humans, even around their cubs, but will sometimes bluff. In the busy spring season, birds are in full song to attract mates and white-tailed deer females, or does, who were pregnant through the winter are birthing their young. Don't be alarmed if you find a fawn seemingly abandoned. Their mothers tuck them away in thickets or behind logs to keep them safe while they forage for themselves. It's necessary for them to do this so they can be adequately nourished to nurse their babies. Fawn are often born in pairs as twins, so if you see one, look around for the other. To help them hide from predators when their mothers are away, fawns have spots when they are young, camouflaging them better in the understory of the forest. They shed this spotted fur at about five months of age as they grow in a heavy winter coat. As you look around, you might notice how sparse vegetation is from the forest floor to a height of about four feet. This is a browse line caused by deer. The deer population in Catoctin Mountain Park is out of balance. There are many factors contributing to their overpopulation, many of which are caused by human attempts to control the natural environment. Many years ago, without realizing the dire consequences, well-intentioned people removed predators, like wolves, coyotes and bobcats thinking that they were bad. The good animals that were left were able to reproduce without natural predators to keep their numbers down. The upset this lack of predation has caused is painfully apparent in Catoctin Mountain Park. Further problems with overpopulation in more recent years, are caused by the affects people have on deer habitat by way of suburban sprawl and other types of development. Because there are so many deer and a limited supply of food, they are forced to over graze the understory of the forest. Their main victims are tree saplings, without which the forest will cease to regenerate. Why don't the deer browse the lush grass that looks like miniature shoots of bamboo? We wish that they would, but they don't like it. This is an invasive species called Japanese stiltgrass. Native of India to East Asia, this grass was first recorded in Tennessee in 1909. At that time, the grass was commonly used as a packing material for Asian porcelain and it's thought that escaped seeds started the invasion. Up to a thousand seeds are produced by each plant allowing the shade-tolerant species to carpet forest floors. Another problematic invasive plant that grows along the trail undisturbed by the deer population is Japanese barberry. Native to Japan, this low compact shrub has small leaves of green, gold and maroon. The small straight spines that line the branches can distinguish barberry from other plants. Introduced in 1864 as an ornamental shrub, it is still a popular landscape shrub available for sale to the public. Exotic species in the park are mostly found alongside roads and trails. Roads and trails serve as vectors for these plants with seeds hitchhiking on car tires, visitor shoelaces or even attached to the fur of wild animals. Unfortunately, a few species like Japanese barberry have spread beyond roads and trails and have permeated into all regions of the park. Because invasive species like these are not vulnerable to the environmental pressures of the area they often grow prolifically. They crowd out native plants by stealing their water, sunlight and nutrients often resulting in habitat loss and a reduction of biodiversity in the forest ecosystem. You'll notice that many of the trees along the trail are double or multiple sprouted, meaning that more than one tree is growing out at the same origin. The multiple spouting that is common throughout the forest is typical evidence of a second growth or secondary succession forest. When trees are cut down, sprouts or saplings often grow out at the stumps as new generations. Their close proximity frequently makes them merge as one or twist together. At the very beginning of the boardwalk to Cunningham Falls, there are some beautiful beech trees that have grown in concert so closely that their intertwining. Before agriculture and industry moved in, Catoctin Mountain's forest and the rest of the forest systems on the Appalachian chain from Maine to Georgia consisted mainly of climactic American chestnut trees. In size, they were the redwoods of the East growing to a height of over 100 feet and a diameter of nearly 10 feet. Picture a tree with a trunk so wide that it would take at least six adults holding hands to form a circle around its base. Renowned for their rot-resistant wood and dependable crop of nuts, American chestnut was of great value to people and wildlife. These giants are now absent from the landscape, a tragic loss which has been said to be one of the worst natural calamities ever experienced in the United States. In the early nineteen hundred's, a fungus was accidentally introduced into New York City from trees imported from Asia. The blight quickly spread on its new host, the American chestnut, destroying it throughout its range. The infection reached the Catoctins in 1912, and by the nineteen forties had killed most of the larger chestnut trees. American chestnuts can still be found in the understory as shoots from the blight resistant roots. They can be identified by their narrow and sharply serrated leaves. Sadly, by the time the trees reach 20 feet in height, the blight attacks through cracks in their bark bringing certain death. Today, Catoctin Mountain's forest is mainly an oak-hickory deciduous forest, but beech, tulip poplars, dogwood and maple, among others, are common among the Falls Nature Trail, as well. Deciduous forests like the one encompassing Catoctin Mountain Park are special for many reasons. One of which being the awe inspiring color display they give us when they lose their leaves in autumn. This type of forest is only found in a few areas of the entire world, the eastern portions of the United States and Canada and in parts of Asia and Europe. Unfortunately, much of the deciduous forests in areas other than North America have been vastly depleted, making the Appalachian region's deciduous forests arguably the best examples left on earth. One of the easiest trees to identify, shagbark hickory, looks like its bark is peeling off in vertical strips giving it a uniquely shaggy appearance. It has the compound, elongated leaves typical of all hickories. Beech is one of the more common trees along this trail. It has finely toothed papery leaves and smooth light grey bark. Almost all of the trees that you see carved with people's initials are beech. Because of the bark's texture, it is tempting for some people to leave a permanent mark. Unfortunately, the carvings leave the tree vulnerable to disease, pests and temperature extremes, not to mention that they are eyesore and the act is illegal. Tulip poplars are easy to identify in the spring by their beautiful yellow, orange, pink and green tulip-like blooms. Dogwood, a low-growing tree with distinctive layers of branches is another flowering tree native to this area. It's white to light pink, four-petal blooms are synonymous with spring in the Catoctin Mountains. There are a number species of plants in Catoctin Mountain Park that have been used for medicinal purposes throughout the region for many years. Witch hazel and spicebush are particularly common throughout the forest and along the Falls Nature Trail. Both are large shrubs, meaning that they may be as large as some low-growing trees, but have multiple branches coming from their base, rather than a distinctive trunk. Spicebush is aptly named for the spicy, lemony aroma that it emits when its leaves, or the berries it produces in the fall, are crushed. The roots, branches, leaves and berries have been used by many to produce natural remedies for coughs and colds. Spicebush also provides important sustenance for wildlife. Witch hazel is used still today for its natural astringent properties. You can find it in your local drugstore with the first aid supplies or as an additive in skin care products. Squawroot, also called cancer root, for its supposed cancer-fighting properties, is a non-photosynthesizing wildflower that looks a bit like corn on the cob. In the spring, this yellow to brown plant produces tiny white and cream-colored, tightly clustered flowers. Found mainly around the bases of oaks and beech, they feed off of the roots of their host tree. Because they're so small, this parasitism does not affect the tree in any detrimental way. Squawroot is named for its use by Native American women to treat symptoms of menopause. There are several other plants found along the Falls Nature Trail including the wildflowers Hepatica, Wood and Rue Anemone, Bluets and Pussytoes that also have traditional, medicinal and dietary uses by wildlife, Native Americans and modern residents alike. Flowering plants, like trees and wildflowers, generate blooms to help them reproduce. Flowers carry both portions of genetic information necessary to produce offspring, just as men and women each carry half what is necessary to have a baby. Plants can carry everything for reproduction in a single individual or take turns bearing male or female genetics from season to season. A flower's primary job is to be pretty. They are a beautiful lure by color, fragrance or shape for pollinators like insects, bats and birds to dip inside looking for a meal. As the pollinator is trying to eat, it accidentally transports pollen, the male portion of a plant, to the female portion of the plant deeper inside the flower. When these two parts mix properly, the plant is able to produce fruit. The fruit of any flowering plant, be it an acorn, walnut, berry or pine cone, is the next generation of that plant species, a baby tree, shrub, flower or fern. Without flowers and their pollinator partners, we would grieve the loss of much of the beautiful landscape and wildlife, as well as missing out on apples, berries most nuts and honey. Because plant life in Catoctin Mountain Park, especially the wildflower population, is threatened by many environmental factors, such as deer browse and invasive species we urge you to observe and enjoy, but not pick anything. We want to be sure that the beauty you see perseveres for others to appreciate in the future. As you travel farther along the trail, you may wonder why there are so many downed trees. When Hurricane Isabel hit the U.S. in September of 2003, she brought major storms that inflicted severe damage along the Falls Nature Trail. Some storm damage wood is recycled as firewood or building materials here at the park. Downed wood that is not hazardous to people is left to fulfill its role in the ecosystem and provides a special opportunity to examine root systems and the insides of trees closely. A tree that has been sawed off shows the layers of growth that developed through its lifetime as rings. Count the rings to approximate the age the tree was when it died. Thinner rings indicate times of drought. Black spots and holes are usually a sign of disease or insect damage. There are several very large trees that were pushed over by wind, exposing massive root systems. The roots of a tree are like drinking straws used to absorb water and soil nutrients and transport them to the rest of the tree. they also provide vital structural support and store nutrients to use in the production of spring foliage. Root systems generally spread out widthwise one to five times the length of the farthest reaching tree limb, but mainly go down only about 18 inches. Forest ecosystems are important, not just for wildlife, but also for humankind. Former President George Bush Senior explained the significance of forests well when he said, \"Trees can reduce the heat on a hot summer's day, quiet highway noise, feed the hungry, provide shelter from the wind and warmth in the winter. You see, forests are the sanctuaries, not only of wildlife, but also of the human spirit and every tree is a compact between generations.\" At this point, you're welcome to turn off or pause this program until you arrive at Cunningham Falls. This podcast will continue with an explanation of the unique geology and natural history of the area. Remember, to be extremely careful when crossing Route 77 to get to the falls boardwalk path. At 78 feet in length, Cunningham Falls is the largest cascading waterfall in Maryland. Known historically as McAfee Falls for the original owners of the property, the name was changed when a photographer named Cunningham made the area famous in the late nineteen forties. Here at an elevation of thirteen hundred feet, Big Hunting Creek surges over a metabasalt slope of greenstone forming the falls over a steep gradient of 9.4 percent. The water flows through riffles, runs pools and drops as high as 12 feet and eventually flows into the man-made Hunting Creek Lake in Cunningham Falls State Park. It continues as Big Hunting Creek flows into the Monocacy River, then the Potomac and finally into the Chesapeake Bay making Catoctin an important watershed area of the bay and ultimately of the Atlantic Ocean. 600 million years ago when lava flowed over the land, the development of the Catoctin metabasalt formation began. The greenstone making up this area resulted from the cooling of lava that at one point was over 2,000 feet thick in places. Over millions of years of pressure and erosion, this geologic area became one of the hardest and oldest exposed metamorphic rock formations in the United States. Over four hundred million years ago, through uplifting caused by major tectonic plate shifts, the Appalachian Mountains, one of the oldest mountain ranges in the world, begin its formation. The Catoctin Mountains make up the easternmost portion of the Blue Ridge province of that range. After the final plate thrust 65 million years ago, streams began their down cutting process carving through the new mountains, deepening valleys and establishing stream beds. The falls began being chiseled out when the down cutting stream that would become Big Hunting Creek encountered the erosion-resistant greenstone of the metabasalt formation of the Catoctins. Falls and pools were formed as the water tried to follow the path of least resistance down the mountain. Because waterfalls are in a state of constant, but extremely gradual change, they tend to move upstream over many years. The Cunningham Falls we see today are not exactly the same as the ones originally named, but the differences may not be noticeable. As time progresses, Big Hunting Creek will continue to cut new falls farther and farther upstream as it wages its battle against the greenstone in its attempt to reach the ocean. This concludes our podcast tour of the Falls Nature Trail. Thank you for being with us here today. As you admire the falls and then hike back along the trail to the trail head, think about the amazing change this area has seen and the changes that are yet to come. Enjoy the sounds of nature and the beauty surrounding you here in the Catoctin Mountains.",
