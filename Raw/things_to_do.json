If you have a boat tour scheduled in Munising, give yourself extra time to get there. <br /> <br /> <strong>COMING FROM MUNISING: (west side of the park)</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Munising Falls / Sand Point</strong><br /> Both Munising Falls and the beaches of Sand Point can be enjoyed in an hour. Head east out of Munising on Alger County Road H-58 one mile and turn left on Washington Street. (Watch for road signs to Munising Falls and Sand Point.) The Munising Falls parking lot is across from the hospital. Walk the paved 800-ft. trail to Munising Falls. <strong>Leashed pets allowed.</strong><br /> <br /> Afterwards, drive two more miles down Sand Point Road to the beaches at the end. Enjoy stunning views of Grand Island across the bay. Both Munising Falls and Sand Point have plowed roads and parking lots that can be accessed by vehicle in winter. <strong>Leashed pets allowed.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Sand Point / Sand Point Marsh Trail</strong><br /> You can easily spend an hour at Sand Point walking the beach and also exploring the 1/2 mile boardwalk Sand Point Marsh Trail through some of the park's most beautiful wetlands. See directions to Sand Point above. The wheelchair-accessible trail loop begins at the main Sand Point Beach parking lot. This is a great place for kids, bird watchers, and all nature lovers. <strong>Pets are not allowed on the Sand Point Marsh Trail</strong>.<br /> <br /> <strong>Miners Falls</strong><br /> The parking lot for the Miners Falls trail is approximately 9 miles from Munising. Follow Alger County Road H-58 five miles east to Miners Castle Road (H-11). Turn left and go four miles north to the turn-off for Miners Falls. Turn right and drive 1/2 mile to parking lot. From the parking lot, the trail is 1.2 miles round-trip. The gently rolling trail goes through a beautiful northwoods forest, ending at two viewing platforms for Miners Falls. <strong>Leashed pets allowed.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Miners Castle / Miners Beach </strong><br /> You can spend as little or as much time as you like at these two locations - however, they are both doable in an hour. Miners Castle is approximately 11 miles from Munising. Follow Alger County Road H-58 five miles east to Miners Castle Road (H-11). Turn left and go six miles north to Miners Castle. This is the only place where you can drive on the cliffs. The main viewing platform is just a short walk from the parking lot. Allow at least a half hour at Miners Castle if you want to walk to all three viewing platforms. <strong>Leashed pets allowed on paved (not dirt) trails, at viewing platforms, and in picnic area. </strong><br /> <br /> Once you leave the Miners Castle parking lot, take the first left and drive the road one mile to the Miners Beach parking lot. You can take a quick walk out to the beach just to see the view or spend more time there. Allow at least a half hour if you want to walk west down the beach to Miners River and back. <strong>Leashed pets allowed on beach and in water. <br /> <br /> COMING FROM GRAND MARAIS</strong>: <strong>(east side of the park)</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Sable Falls / Sable Beach</strong><br /> Drive one mile west of the town of Grand Marais on Alger County Road H-58 to the Sable Falls parking lot. A short walk from the parking lot leads to a long staircase of 168 steps down to the main falls viewing platform. After viewing the falls, continue on the trail along Sable Creek for another 1/4 mile out to Sable Beach. Enjoy the views of the Grand Sable Dunes towering to the left and the expanse of Lake Superior ahead. <strong>Leashed pets allowed.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Grand Sable Dunes Trail</strong><br /> The 0.6 roundtrip trail to the Grand Sable Dunes also begins in the Sable Falls area. Park at the Sable Falls parking lot and walk towards the falls. The intersection of the Grand Sable Dunes Trail begins near the top of the falls. The trail goes through an old homestead field, across Sable Creek, through a forested dune ecosystem, and ends on top of the dunes.<br /> <br /> Once at the top, walk a short distance to the right for a spectacular view of Lake Superior. The trail is fairly level, but there are some uphill sections of walking in sand. <strong>Pets are not allowed on the Grand Sable Dunes Trail.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Log Slide</strong><br /> The Log Slide area highlights the logging history of this area and provides a stunning view of the Grand Sable Dunes.<strong> </strong>Drive approximately 8 miles west of Grand Marais on Alger County Road H-58 to the Log Slide parking lot. Walk the short path towards the dunes and read the interpretive signs along the way.<br /> <br /> At the intersection of the North Country Trail you can climb the large dune ahead to get various views. Those who don't want to climb in sand can turn left on the North Country Trail and walk just a few yards to the level spur trail to the right (at the end of the wooden fence). Walk out to the edge of the dune for great views of the sand dunes to the right, and the Au Sable Lighthouse to the left. Take care not to get too close to the dune edge. Watch for poison ivy along the trail. <strong>Pets are not allowed in the Log Slide area or nearby dunes.</strong></p>",

            "longDescription": "<strong>Sand Point Marsh Trail</strong> - Length: 0.5 mile loop. Located across from Sand Point Beach, this boardwalk trail takes you through one of the park's most beautiful wetlands. Old beach ridges, a cattail marsh, small ponds, and white cedar and black spruce swamp communities dominate the scene.<br /> <br /> The best times for wildlife activity are early or late in the day. The entire trail loop is wheelchair-accessible when ice and snow are absent. This trail is easy to access year-round since Sand Point Road and the beach/trail parking area is plowed all winter.<strong> Pets not allowed on the marsh trail.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Munising Falls</strong> - Length: 800 feet one way. Walk this paved trail up the cool, shaded sandstone canyon along Munising Creek to the main viewing platform to see the 50-foot drop waterfall. Two sets of stairs lead to elevated platforms that offer different views of the water as it drops over a sandstone cliff. Please stay on the paved trail. <strong>Going into or behind the falls is dangerous and is prohibited.</strong><br /> <br /> The central viewing platform is wheelchair-accessible. Waterfalls are beautiful in winter, and Munising Falls is easy to access as the road and parking lot is plowed all winter. <strong>Leashed pets allowed on trail and at platforms.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Miners Castle Overlook</strong> - Length varies: 200 to 1300 feet one way. This is the most popular spot in the park. Miners Castle can be viewed from 3 different viewing platforms. The two upper viewing areas are wheelchair-accessible and are a short distance from the parking lot. The walk to the lower platform includes stairs and steep inclines. <strong>Leashed pets are allowed on paved (not dirt) trails, at viewing platforms, and in picnic area.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Superior Overlook Beach</strong> - Offers a beautiful view of Lake Superior and short stairway access to a beach. A brief walk on the beach leads to Sullivan's Creek emptying into Lake Superior. The overlook platform is wheelchair-accessible from the parking lot. <strong>Leashed pets allowed</strong>.<br /> <br /> <strong>Twelvemile Beach </strong>- Access via stairs from the tall bluff at the day-use picnic and parking area near the campground down to a sandy beach that has great sunset views. <strong>Leashed pets allowed on beach in front of and to the east of the campground. Pets not allowed on beach west of the campground.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Log Slide Overlook Trail</strong> - Length: 0.3 mile roundtrip. This short trail leads through mature hardwoods to the western edge of the Grand Sable Dunes where logs once slid down to the lake in a wooden chute.<br /> <br /> The overlook platform was destroyed in a winter storm but the path to the platform location is still there. You'll be rewarded with breathtaking views of Lake Superior, the Grand Sable Dunes, and Au Sable Lighthouse in the distance. <strong>Pets not allowed.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Grand Sable Dunes Trail</strong> - Length: 0.6 mile roundtrip. This is the main access point into the Grand Sable Dunes. The trail starts at the Sable Falls parking area near the top of the falls, continues past an old orchard and field, and crosses a bridge over Sable Creek. It then winds through a jack pine forest gradually uphill into an open dune environment. Requires some uphill climbing in sand. <strong>Pets not allowed.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Sable Falls Trail</strong> – Length: 0.4 mile roundtrip. Part of the North Country Scenic Trail. From the Sable Falls parking lot, this trail starts with 168 steps down to the base of the falls and and continues past the falls along Sable Creek to a rock and sand beach on Lake Superior. The first landing on the stairs provides a view of Sable Falls, although the best view is from the bottom. <strong>Leashed pets allowed on trail and stairs.</strong><br /> <br /> <br /> Visit the park's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/dayhikes.htm\">Day Hikes webpage</a> for more \"Things to Know\" about hiking at Pictured Rocks.",

            "longDescription": "<p><strong>Miners Falls Trail</strong> - Length: 1.2 miles roundtrip. This easy trail takes you through the forest to Miners River, where the park's most powerful waterfall cascades 50 feet over a sandstone cliff. Take another 64 steps down to a lower platform. <strong>Leashed pets allowed.<br /> <br /> Miners Castle to Miners Beach</strong> - Length: 2 miles roundtrip. Part of the North Country Scenic Trail. Take the trail from Miners Castle downhill to Miners Beach, crossing the Miners River along the way. Enjoy the beach and then hike back up - or shorten the walk by having a friend pick you up in the Miners Beach parking lot. <strong>Pets not allowed on the trail.</strong> (However pets are allowed at Miners Castle and at Miners Beach - just not on the trail between the two.)<br /> <br /> <strong>Sable Creek Trail</strong> - Length: 2.0 miles roundtrip. Pretty wooded walk between the Grand Sable Visitor Center and the Sable Falls area. Part of the North Country Scenic Trail. The trail offers a stroll through a mature maple forest, along Sable Creek, and through an old farm field. Also intersects the Grand Sable Dunes Trail at 0.8 miles. <strong>Pets not allowed.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Au Sable Light Station</strong> - Length: 3.0 miles roundtrip. Leaving from Hurricane River Campground, walk on the old access road (part of the North Country Scenic Trail) back in time to an isolated Lake Superior lighthouse. Exposed shipwreck remains dot the shoreline, and the quiet light station gives you a feeling of yesteryear where families lived and worked from 1874 to 1958. Guided tours of the lighthouse are provided in summer. <strong>Leashed pets allowed on road and light station grounds. Bicycles are NOT allowed on this road. </strong><br /> <br /> <strong>White Birch Trail</strong> - Length: 2.0 miles. Self-guided interpretive trail at Twelvemile Beach Campground explores the natural history of the uplands adjacent to the lake - an environment very different from that near the campground. Non-campers park at the day-use area and walk through the campground to Site 6, where trail begins. The trail will end on the campground road, one-quarter mile east of the trailhead. <strong>Leashed pets allowed. </strong><br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>CHAPEL BASIN / MOSQUITO AREA</strong> - A number of different trails and hikes are available here. All hikes begin at the Chapel/Mosquito trailhead parking lot, at the end of Chapel Road. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/upload/Chapel-Beaver-Day-Hikes-Map-508.pdf\">View and download this map</a> (pdf) before you hike these trails. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>NO PETS</strong></span> allowed on any of the trails or beaches in this area. <br /> <br /> <strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><u>Note</u>:</span> Primitive road to trailhead parking with deep pot holes and washouts. LIMITED PARKING AT TRAILHEAD - plan to arrive early in the day.</strong></p>   <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mosquito Falls</strong> - Length: 2 miles roundtrip. From the Chapel parking lot, head towards Mosquito Beach. At 0.3 miles take a side trail that leads 0.7 miles to Mosquito Falls. The Mosquito River cascades in short falls over three rock shelves, the highest being 8 feet. <strong>Pets not allowed.</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Chapel Falls</strong> - Length: 2.5 miles roundtrip. Leaving from the Chapel parking lot, this easy hike runs along an old roadbed through upland maple forest to stunning, 60-foot high Chapel Falls. <strong>Pets not allowed.</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mosquito Beach</strong> - Length: 3.9 miles roundtrip straight out and back; 4.5 miles via loop back past Mosquito Falls. Trail is usually very muddy and rough. Follow the trail from the Chapel parking lot through lowland hemlock and mixed forest to Mosquito Beach. This beautiful beach is bordered by stunning rock cliffs and sandstone terraces. Return on same trail or continue on loop and return past Mosquito Falls. <strong>Pets not allowed.</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Chapel Rock & Chapel Beach </strong>- Length: 6.2 miles roundtrip (from parking lot). Trail passes Chapel Falls and continues to Chapel Rock and Chapel Beach. Take pictures, but keep off Chapel Rock. Return the way you came or make a loop by taking the forest trail back along the north/west side of Chapel Lake. <strong>Pets not allowed.</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Chapel Loop</strong> - Length: Full loop, including Mosquito Falls, is 10 miles from the parking lot (longer from the road). This popular loop begins at the Chapel parking lot, passes Chapel Falls, Chapel Rock, Chapel Beach and continues along the Pictured Rocks cliffs to Mosquito River and Beach, and back to the parking lot on the outer loop trail past Mosquito Falls. Or you can follow the loop in the other direction! <strong>Pets not allowed</strong>. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong><u>Note:</u> Walk carefully along this cliff edge!</strong></span><br />  </p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>BEAVER BASIN WILDERNESS</strong> - Several hikes can be made in the Beaver Basin area leaving from the day-use trailhead parking lot near the end of Little Beaver Lake Road. <strong>Pets not allowed anywhere in the wilderness zone.</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Beaver Basin Wilderness Loop </strong>- Length: 5.5 mile loop. Enjoy this scenic and diverse hike through several forest types, around the north side of Beaver Lake, along Beaver Creek, and back along part of the North Country Scenic Trail near Lake Superior. <strong>Pets not allowed.</strong></p> </li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>NORTH COUNTRY SCENIC TRAIL (formerly called the Lakeshore Trail)</strong> - Length: Up to 42 miles (through the park). In addition to some of the trails listed above, there are other North Country Scenic Trail segments in the park, like Miners Castle to Sand Point, or Log Slide to Au Sable Light Station. <strong>No pets allowed on this trail except in certain limited areas. </strong>Check at a visitor center for more information.<br /> <br /> Visit the park's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/dayhikes.htm\">Day Hikes webpage</a> for more \"Things to Know\" about hiking at Pictured Rocks.</p>",

The Elwha is the Olympic Peninsula's largest watershed, and home to salmon and trout. For millenia, the Klallam people relied on fish nurtured by the Elwha River watershed. But two dams on the river constructed in 1913 and 1927 were built without fish passage, meaning that thousands of salmon could no longer reach the Elwha Valley. After careful planning, both dams were removed in 2014. Within months of the dams' removal, salmon were spawning in the park for the first time in 100 years! See this impressive river and hear its rushing waters to experience the success of this restoration project.<br /> <br /> Then, continue beyond the parking lot on a 0.1-mile, paved, gently sloping trail leading to Madison Falls.

Peaceful inland lakes invite canoers to linger in the northwoods and listen for loons. Pontoon and other motorized boat owners will enjoy exploring miles of sandstone cliffs and remote sandy beaches along the Lake Superior shoreline. New paddleboarders can practice in the sheltered waters of Munising Bay.<br /> <br /> Generally, there are three boating areas easy to access within the park: Lake Superior (and Munising Bay); Little Beaver Lake (which connects to Beaver Lake), and Grand Sable Lake. <strong>Pets are not allowed in boats on Little Beaver or Beaver Lakes, since they are within the Beaver Basin Wilderness. </strong> <strong>Pets are also not allowed on Lake Superior beaches within the wilderness zone.</strong></p> <h4><strong>IF BOATING ON LAKE SUPERIOR...</strong></h4> <p><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Safety First!</strong></span> Check the marine weather forecast before venturing out. Watch the weather carefully while on the lake. The weather can change suddenly and unexpectedly. The Pictured Rocks cliffs rise 50 to 200 feet directly from the lake, offering precious few protected places if the wind and waves increase. Also check local weather buoys for real-time data and video from the buoy cams at <a href=\"http://www.greatlakesbuoys.org/\">www.greatlakesbuoys.org</a><br /> <br /> <strong>Motorized boats (such as pontoons) and sea kayaks are the only kind of boats that should be taken on Lake Superior.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 1.25rem;\">MOTORIZED BOATS</strong></p> <p>Boats and motors of any size are permitted on Lake Superior. Horsepower is limited to 50 on Grand Sable Lake. <strong>Only electric motors</strong> may be used on Little Beaver Lake and Beaver Lake in the Beaver Basin Wilderness.<br /> <br /> Slow / no wake speed must be maintained within <strong>100 feet</strong> of the shoreline, any watercraft, pier, person, raft, swimming area, and swimmers.<br /> <br /> Boats may be launched into Lake Superior at the City of Munising's boat ramp a mile west of the town harbor on M-28. Burt Township maintains a boat ramp in Grand Marais harbor. There are shallow boat ramps on Grand Sable Lake and Little Beaver Lake.<br /> <br /> An appropriate type and size personal flotation device (PFD) (life jacket) is <strong>required by law</strong> for each person on board any boat. In Michigan, all children under the age of 6 years old must wear a PFD while riding on the open deck of a vessel when it is underway. For more information on boating regulations, visit <a href=\"http://www.uscgboating.org/\">www.uscgboating.org.</a> </p> <h4>CANOES</h4> <p><strong>Canoes should NOT be taken out on Lake Superior</strong>. Their height makes them hard to control in windy conditions on open water, and they can be easily swamped by waves. Instead take your canoe to one of the park's beautiful inland lakes:  Little Beaver Lake, Beaver Lake, and Grand Sable Lake. </p> <h4>SAILBOATS AND PADDLEBOARDS</h4> <p><strong>Lake Superior</strong> - Small sailboats can be carried from the parking lot to Munising Bay at Sand Point Beach. Munising Bay is a good place for sailing and paddleboarding since it is generally a more sheltered area. Larger boats should use the municipal boat ramps listed above to enter Lake Superior. <br /> <br /> <strong>Inland Lakes</strong> - Little Beaver Lake, Beaver Lake, and Grand Sable Lake are also suitable for small sailboats and paddleboards.<br /> <br /> <strong style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 1.25rem;\">PERSONAL WATERCRAFT</strong></p> <p>Personal watercraft (PWC) such as jet skis may travel within the lakeshore from the western boundary near Sand Point to the eastern end of Miners Beach. PWC are not permitted elsewhere within the lakeshore's one-quarter mile offshore jurisdiction along the Lake Superior shoreline.<br /> <br /> Due to horsepower restrictions, PWC are not allowed on inland lakes within Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore.<br /> <br /> According to State of Michigan law, PWC must not operate from one hour before sunset to 8 am. When traveling within 200 feet of the shoreline, PWC must travel at a slow/no-wake speed perpendicular to the shoreline. </p> <h4><strong>WATER SKIING</strong></h4> <p>Water skiing is authorized on Lake Superior and Grand Sable Lake in accordance with state and federal laws. On Grand Sable Lake, horsepower is limited to 50.</p>",

Free tickets will be available day of at the Gettysburg National Military Park Museum and Visitor Center.</p> <hr /> <p><b>Saturday January 7 - Intelligence Gathering at Culp's Hill</b><br /> <em>Troy Harman, Gettysburg National Military Park </em><br /> Did the Southern Army investigate Culp's Hill before attacking it? It is imagined the Southern Army attacked Culp's Hill for two days without knowing what they were walking into, or how impossible the task. It is generally presumed that if some forethought and investigation of the ground and circumstances had been carried out earlier, the 12 hours of combat there may never have occurred. How much truth is there to hastily attacking the hill without prior knowledge of Union strength, location, and morale? Troy Harman will explore and explain through multiple vivid accounts, illustrations, and maps.<br /> <br /> <b>Sunday January 8</b><b> – </b><b>George Dewey and the American Civil War</b><br /> <em>Karlton Smith, Gettysburg National Military Park</em><br /> This program will explore the Civil War career of future admiral and victor of Manila Bay George Dewey. Join Ranger Karlton Smith and track Dewey’s experiences from his time at Annapolis to the end of the Civil War, and uncover how that pivotal period would shape his post-war activities.<br /> <br /> <b>Saturday January 14 – John Hunt Morgan: Thunderbolt of the Confederacy </b><br /> <em>Matthew Atkinson, Gettysburg National Military Park</em><br /> Known today as one of the great cavalry raiders, Morgan struck fear among the Northern population wherever his command roamed. His swift and daring raids across Kentucky and Ohio are some of the most daring undertakings during the Civil War. Join us for a lecture featuring romance, battle, prison escape, and even bank robberies.<br /> <br /> <b>Sunday January 15 – <a>If These Things Could Talk: Artifacts from the Collection of Gettysburg National Military Park</a></b><br /> <em>Tom Holbrook, Gettysburg National Military Park</em><br /> Explore the museum collection at Gettysburg National Military Park with Ranger Tom Holbrook and discover some of the fascinating stories each object tells. From the simple to the extraordinary, each piece offers a window into the story of the American Civil War.<br /> <br /> <b>Saturday January 21 –</b> <b>Little Round Top: The Vision Place of Souls</b><br /> <em>Christopher Gwinn, Gettysburg National Military Park</em><br /> It is the most famous hill in American history. For 160 years Americans have been captivated by the story of Little Round Top and the desperate fighting that took place there on the afternoon of July 2, 1863. Ranger Christopher Gwinn will examine the story of the battle, the myths and legends that still hover over its rocky slopes, and detail how Little Round Top became a “vision place of souls.”<br /> <br /> <b>Sunday  January  22 - The Great Reunion of 1913</b><br /> <em>John Heiser, Historian</em><br /> In the summer of 1913, Pennsylvania invited thousands of Union and Confederate veterans to come to Gettysburg to observe and celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, what many considered to be the \"High Water Mark the Rebellion\". The response from veterans of the Blue and Gray was overwhelming - over 54,000 old soldiers journeyed to a battlefield skillfully transformed by a government commission into a memorial park, where the armies of both North and South would forever be memorialized. Critics scoffed that old enemies could never get along, the divisions that caused the war in 1861 having not been forgotten. But America was changing at home and abroad and those who chose to ignore this commemoration were surprised at its outcome. Was this \"Great Reunion\" finally the signal of national reunification so many had hoped for fifty years after the final shot had been fired?<br /> <br /> <b>Saturday January  28 – From Second Manassas to Gettysburg: - The True Story of a Texas Brigade Officer and a Union Artillerist</b><br /> <em>Wayne Motts, Gettysburg Foundation</em><br /> Join historian, author, and battlefield guide Wayne Motts as he explores the true and unique story of Benjamin F. Carter of the 4th Texas Infantry and Captain Mark Kerns of Battery G, 1st Pennsylvania Light Artillery and how these two men, fighting on opposite sides during the war, are connected through kind acts. From the battlefields of Virginia to the fighting on July 2, 1863 at Gettysburg, Wayne will present some new information about this moving story.<br /> <br /> <b>Sunday January  29 - From the Iron Brigade to Chief Joseph: John Gibbon's Military Career</b><br /> <em>Karlton Smith, Gettysburg National Military Park</em><br /> This program will look at the military career of Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, focusing on his Civil War service, especially Gettysburg. It will also look at Gibbon's post war service on the frontier and his attitude concerning the Native Americans he encountered.<br /> <br /> <b>Saturday February 4</b><b> </b>- <b>Reading Between the Lines: Soldier Accounts from the Gettysburg Battle</b><br /> <em>Troy Harman, Gettysburg National Military Park </em><br /> Several solider letters and accounts will be examined from the battle, not only for surface level descriptions, but also for patterns to soldier observations, underlying clues to soldier psychology, and deeper cultural messages. This lecture will draw attention to the hidden meanings below the surface.<br /> <br /> <b>Sunday February 5 – What the Ground Lay Bare: Archeology at Little Round Top and Devils Den</b><br /> <em>Erik Kreusch, Gettysburg National Miliary Park</em><br /> Gettysburg National Military Park has been rehabilitating both the Devil's Den as well as the Little Round Top. Archeologists have been conducting metal detector sweeps of areas where ground disturbance was anticipated. The archeological findings have the potential to shed light on the activities of individuals during and immediately following the fight. The program will highlight some of the current findings. This coupled with firsthand narrative accounts allows the park to enhance our understanding and interpretation.<br /> <br /> <b>Saturday February 11 –</b> <b>“First in '61:\" Nicholas \"Nick\" Biddle and Pennsylvania's Forgotten First Defenders  </b><br /> <em>John Hoptak, Gettysburg National Military Park</em><br /> On the evening of April 18, 1861, less than 72 hours after the surrender of Fort Sumter and President Abraham Lincoln's subsequent call-to-arms, the very first Northern volunteer soldiers arrived in the nation's beleaguered capital. Although long overshadowed in history by the more famous 6th Massachusetts Infantry, these soldiers composed the ranks of five companies of Pennsylvania militia who later became known as the \"First Defenders.\" Attacked by a pro-secessionist/pro-Confederate mob in Baltimore on their journey south to Washington, these First Defenders shed some of the very first blood of what would become the country's bloodiest conflict. Included among those injured was Nicholas \"Nick\" Biddle, a sixty-five-year-old African American man who had escaped from slavery, and who now wore the uniform of one of the Pennsylvania companies. Join John Hoptak for a look at the fascinating life and story of Biddle, and the history of these lesser-known companies, their prompt response, and their place in American Civil War history.<br /> <br /> <b>Sunday February 12 (Superbowl Sunday) – No Program<br /> <br /> Saturday February 18 – Robert E. Lee - The Antebellum Years</b><br /> <em>Matthew Atkinson, Gettysburg National Military Park</em><br /> Lee stands today as one of the most influential military leaders in world history. But what were his upbringing, education and experiences that molded the man? Join Ranger Matt Atkinson and explore Lee's life before the Civil War. <br /> <br /> <b>Sunday February 19 – Placing the Platform: Using 3D Technology to Pinpoint Lincoln at Gettysburg</b><br /> <em>Christopher Oakley, Associate Professor, UNC- Asheville</em><br /> Associate Professor Christopher Oakley is a former Disney and DreamWorks animator who teaches Animation in New Media at University of North Carolina Asheville. Since 2013, Christopher has been leading an undergraduate research endeavor called \"The Virtual Lincoln Project,\" in which he and his students are creating a digital photo-real Abraham Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg Address. His lecture Placing the Platform: Using 3D Technology to Pinpoint Lincoln at Gettysburg explores Christopher's digital research that has led him to determine where Lincoln was actually standing when he delivered the Gettysburg Address.<br /> <br /> <b>Saturday February 25</b> –<b> A Crusade for Peace--Eisenhower and the Korean War</b><br /> <em>Daniel Vermilya, Eisenhower National Historic Site</em><br /> 70 Years ago, Dwight D. Eisenhower ascended to the presidency at a time of great unrest and conflict. Nowhere was that conflict greater than in the Korean peninsula, where Americans had been fighting and dying by the thousands for several years. Join Eisenhower NHS Ranger Dan Vermilya to explore Eisenhower's crusade for peace in Korea, America's forgotten war. This program will provide special Gettysburg connections to the Korean War by highlighting stories in Gettysburg National Cemetery, and will also feature the newest addition to the Eisenhower NHS museum collection, the parka that President-Elect Eisenhower wore during his visit to Korea in December 1952.<br /> <br /> <b>Sunday February 26 – Gettysburg and the Civil War: From County Seat to National Symbol</b><br /> <em>Barbara Sanders, Gettysburg National Military Park</em><br /> Residents of Gettysburg and Adams County were not just passive observers of the 1863 battle. Its citizens included men who fought on both sides of the conflict, women who took in or traveled to the wounded after the battle, African Americans who dug the graves for the dead, and generations who worked to support the community from its modest time as county seat of government, to the site of a major battle, host of veterans' reunions, and creation of a National Park. Stories of its most noteworthy townspeople will illuminate this ever-changing community as a microcosm of a nation moving forward from immense conflict to create a universal symbol of freedom, sacrifice, equality and democracy.<br /> <br /> <b>Saturday March 4 –</b> <b>Inclement Weather Make-up Date if Needed<br /> <br /> Sunday March 5 –</b> <b>Inclement Weather Make-up Date if Needed</b><br /> <br />  </p> <h2>History Kids Reading Adventures Club</h2> <p>For elementary-aged kids who love to read and parents who want their kids to love reading, this winter reading program teaches budding history buffs about important events and important people in history, with a focus on the Civil War era. Children ages 4-10 and their families are invited to join a park educator every Saturday from <strong>11 am to 11:45 am</strong> to hear a new book and discover a new story.

While the trail does pass through some shaded areas, we recommend you pack sunscreen, a hat, plenty of water, and bug spray.<br /> <br /> The trail is open all year. However, the road leading to the Nature Trail is closed to driving as soon as the snow gets too high. This time varies each year, but the road is usually closed sometime in November and usually reopens sometime in May. Sking and snowshoeing are excellent alternatives for reaching the Nature Trail in the winter.<br /> <br /> Please be cautious hiking at Fossil Butte National Monument. The trailhead is located at approximately 7000 ft (2134 m) elevation in a desert; you will get sunburned and dehydrated more easily than at lower elevations. The air is also much thinner than at lower elevations and can put more strain on you. Avoid hiking during thunderstorms.",

The air is also much thinner than at lower elevations and can put more strain on you. There is no shade on the trail and conditions can get very hot during the summer. As dry as the landscape may look, hidden streams and ponds attract plenty of mosquitoes during the summer months. Be sure to pack sunscreen, a hat, bug spray, and plenty of water.

            "longDescription": "Feel the sand between your toes. Marvel at amazing rock formations. Watch fascinating tidepool creatures. Have a seat on a driftwood log and watch the waves roll in.<br /> <br /> A trip to the Olympic Coast is sure to be memorable! Olympic National Park contains several beach areas along the coast, each with something to offer.<br /> <br /> The recommendations in this article are for \"frontcountry\" beach experiences. If you are interested in backcountry or wilderness hiking along the Pacific Coast, click <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/wilderness.htm\">here</a>. <h2>Beach Safety</h2> <br /> Before you learn about the beaches of Olympic National Park and choose your destination, be sure to read through these beach safety rules! <ul> <li><strong>Don't get trapped by a rising tide! </strong>Several points along the coast are only passable at lower tides. Always carry a tide chart. Tide charts are available at visitor centers and ranger stations. Information on tides from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration can be found <a href=\"https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/map/index.html\">here</a>. Know when the tides will occur (don't guess!) and plan your hike accordingly.</li> <li>Strong winds and storms can significantly elevate tides and create hazardous conditions. Pay attention to your surroundings and <strong>never underestimate the power of the Pacific Ocean!</strong></li> <li>Powerful waves can roll and tumble driftwood logs. <b>Do not play on beach logs</b>, especially when the tide is high.</li> <li><strong>Rip currents are dangerous! </strong>Swim at your own risk. Learn more about how to spot rip currents and what to do if you're caught in one <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/tae/ripcurrentawareness\">here</a>.</li> </ul> <h2>Kalaloch and Ruby Beach</h2> <br /> Looking for a mellow, accessible, or pet-friendly trip to the beach? Kalaloch and Ruby Beach are great picks!<br /> <br /> Kalaloch is located along US Highway 101. A ranger station is open in summer months. Overnight visitors can camp at the year-round <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/camping.htm\">Kalaloch Campground</a> or stay at the concessioner-operated <a href=\"https://www.thekalalochlodge.com/\">Kalaloch Lodge</a>. The Kalaloch Creek Nature Trail begins near the entrance to the campground and offers an easy loop through a coastal forest. Trails from the lodge and campground lead to a sandy beach below a bluff. The beach near Kalaloch is a fantastic place to birdwatch, watch the sunset, and take a look at the Tree of Life - a truly epic tree balanced on the bluff that can be a great spot for photos! If you visit the Tree of Life, or any Kalaloch beaches, please be sure to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/leave-no-trace-seven-principles.htm\">Leave No Trace</a> and use caution when walking around areas with lots of driftwood.<br /> <br /> Ruby Beach is located just 7.5 miles north of Kalaloch and has an accessible viewpoint, parking lot, and restrooms. At this point along the coast, Cedar Creek feeds into the Pacific Ocean. Explore fascinating geology and tide pools on this beach - but watch your step for driftwood, which can sometimes cover parts of this beach!<br /> <br /> Pets are allowed on Kalaloch area beaches and at Ruby Beach. Pets must be on a leash at all times. Pet waste must be picked up and disposed of properly. Learn more about bringing pets to Olympic National Park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">here</a>.<br /> <br /> Learn more about visiting Kalaloch and Ruby Beach <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/visiting-kalaloch-and-ruby-beach.htm\">here</a>. <h2>Rialto Beach</h2> <br /> Rocky Rialto Beach features giant drift logs, pounding waves, and views of offshore islands known as \"seastacks.\" Get to Rialto Beach from Highway 101 by traveling east on State Route 110 (also known as La Push Road), then turning right on Mora Road to cross the Quillayute River. On the way to Rialto Beach, you'll pass through the Mora area, which includes a seasonally-operated ranger station, nature trails, restrooms, and a campground. At the end of Mora Road, you'll reach the beach! A 200-foot path to the beach is made accessible by a temporary ramp in summer months.<br /> <br /> Feeling adventurous? Hike 1.5 miles north along Rialto Beach to Hole-in-the-Wall, an arching rock formation. Be sure to check tide tables before you hike! If you're planning to continue north along the North Coast Trail, you'll need a wilderness permit and a bear can.<br /> <br /> Pets are allowed at Rialto Beach, but only from the parking lot to Ellen Creek. Pets must be on a leash at all times. Pet waste must be picked up and disposed of properly. Learn more about bringing pets to Olympic National Park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">here</a>.<br /> <br /> Learn more about visiting Rialto Beach and the Mora area <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/visiting-mora-and-rialto.htm\">here</a>. <h2>Second and Third Beaches</h2> <br /> Looking for both a forest hike and a day at the beach? Second and Third Beaches are great spots to see the interplay between coastal forests and sandy beaches.<br /> <br /> Trailheads to Second and Third Beaches can be found along State Route 110 (also known as La Push Road).<br /> <br /> As you drive along this road, you will first come to the trailhead for Third Beach. The trail to Third Beach takes you through a forested area for 1.4 miles before descending 270 feet to a sandy beach. If you're planning to continue south on the South Coast Trail to Oil City, you'll need a wilderness permit and a bear can.<br /> <br /> The trail to Second Beach begins at a parking lot located on the Quileute Indian Reservation. Please be respectful and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/leave-no-trace-seven-principles.htm\">Leave No Trace</a> during your visit to the reservation. Travel south along the .7-mile trail into the national park, winding through a coastal forest before descending 200 feet to a sandy beach with seastacks and tidepools.<br /> <br /> Pets are not allowed on the trails to Second and Third Beaches, or on the beaches themselves. <h2>Ozette</h2> <br /> Can't decide if you want to visit the ocean or a lake? Take a trip to Ozette! The Ozette area of Olympic National Park is reached via the Hoko-Ozette Road off Highway 112. A parking lot is located near a seasonally-operated ranger station, accessible restrooms, picnic areas, and a campground. From here, get a look at beautiful Lake Ozette, then embark on one of two trails leading to the beach: the 3.1-mile Cape Alava Trail or the 2.8-mile Sandpoint Trail. The two trails connect via the Ozette Loop to create a 9-mile loop.<br /> <br /> Only have time to pick one trail? Pick your beach preference! The Cape Alava Trail leads through prairies and forests and ends at a rocky beach. The Sandpoint Trail leads through the coastal forest to a wide, sandy beach.<br /> <br /> Both the Cape Alava and Sandpoint Trails are mostly covered by boardwalks. In frosty or wet conditions, watch your step! Boardwalks can become slippery.<br /> <br /> Pets are not allowed on the Ozette area trails or on the beach itself.<br /> <br /> Learn more about visiting Ozette <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/visiting-ozette.htm\">here</a>. <h2>Start planning your trip!</h2> <br /> Find more information to start planning your trip to Olympic National Park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/index.htm\">here</a>.",

It is usually between 14.5 - 18 feet long, and between 18 to 24 inches wide. Sea kayaks have bulkheads to prevent water from flooding the entire boat. <strong>A sea kayak is the only type of kayak that should be used on Lake Superior.</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>A <strong>recreational or general purpose kayak </strong>is for the casual paddler on placid rivers, ponds, or small lakes. It is smaller than 14 feet long and has a larger opening for the paddler to sit in. Recreational kayaks <strong>should </strong><u><strong>NOT</strong></u> be used on Lake Superior or used on windy days.</p> </li> <li> <p>A <strong>canoe</strong> is an open boat that is wider than a kayak. Their height makes them hard to control in windy conditions on open water. Unless packed with flotation, they can also fill with water and more easily swamp. Canoes <strong>should <u>NOT</u></strong> be used on Lake Superior!</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you are using a canoe or recreational kayak, consider paddling on inland lakes or nearby rivers (such as the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/hiawatha/recarea/?recid=13322\">Au Train River</a> west of the park). Little Beaver Lake, Beaver Lake, and Grand Sable Lake within Pictured Rocks are easy to access by vehicle.<br />  </p> <p><strong style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 1.25rem;\">Before you go out on Lake Superior, check the weather.</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Check the marine weather forecast before venturing out. Watch the weather carefully while on the lake. The weather can change suddenly and unexpectedly. </p> </li> <li>The Pictured Rocks cliffs rise 50 to 200 feet directly from the lake, offering precious few protected places if the wind and waves increase. Also check local weather buoys for real-time data and video from the buoy cams at <a href=\"http://www.greatlakesbuoys.org/\">www.greatlakesbuoys.org</a> <br />  </li> </ul> <p><strong>Remember...</strong></p> <p>Cell phones may or may not work at the park. Even if you are able to get a 911 call out, help is still far away, 30 minutes at least. Rescue time of 60 to 90 minutes or longer is more likely. If the weather is very rough, no one will be able to respond until the weather calms down.<br /> <br /> You need to be able to perform a self-rescue. Read, research on-line, take lessons. And then practice, practice, practice!<br /> <br /> Always wear your life jacket! Wear a wetsuit. <strong>Cold water kills!</strong><br /> <br /> Paddle with others. Make sure they know how to perform rescues too.<br /> <br /> Leave a float plan with someone who cares about you. This includes information such as your name, type of boat and equipment used, and your planned route and schedule. Don't forget to tell them when you get back so they would know when to start searching.<br /> <br /> <strong>Kayaking with your pet is NOT recommended on Lake Superior. Please talk to a park ranger about other options for kayaking with your pet.</strong></p>",

Shoreline water temperatures in summer usually range from the upper 50s to the upper 60s. Some years it can reach 70 degrees by mid-August in Munising Bay. Sand Point Beach generally has the warmest summer water temperatures.<br /> <br /> There are no lifeguarded beaches at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore or its surrounding communities. <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_currents/03coastal3.html\">Rip currents</a> can and do occur. Rip currents do not always appear in the same spot every time; they can change position. Other hazards include large waves and hidden underwater logs and boulders. Sand bars can drop off quickly into deep water. Please use extreme caution if you choose to venture into Lake Superior. <br /> <br /> <b>Caution:</b> Do not jump off rocks or cliffs into the water! It is illegal within the national lakeshore to jump off any part of cliffs or rocks higher than 15 feet above the lake level. Climbing to the top of Miners Castle from the water or on any part of Chapel Rock is prohibited. Areas for cliff jumping exist in Marquette.<br /> <br /> Jumping into the water from any height is generally not safe here. The water depth can be difficult to predict and there's a good chance of rocks or logs in the water. Impact with the water can cause injury, and injury can lead to drowning. Hitting a solid surface under water is often deadly. If you want to go in the water, walk in from the beaches. <br /> <br /> Certain beaches allow leashed pets - check the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">pets</a> page for information..<br /> <br /> Inland lakes with sandy bottom areas suitable for swimming include Beaver Lake and Grand Sable Lake. Ask at a visitor center for information on how to access these lakes.<br />  </p>",

The nearly 100 miles of park trails includes the North Country National Scenic Trail which runs 42 miles through the length of the park, adjacent to Lake Superior. Most of the park's 13 designated backpacking camping areas are along this trail. These small backcountry campgrounds have 3 to 6 individual sites. There are also 8 group backpacking sites throughout the park. All of these sites are only accessible to campers by foot and some by boat. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is one boat-in-only site, at Grand Sable Lake on the park's east end. Campers must supply their own boat. Boats are launched at the Grand Sable Lake boat ramp. <br /> <br /> <strong>THINGS TO KNOW</strong></p> <p>Backcountry campers <strong><u>must</u></strong> stay in specific backcountry campgrounds and numbered site as noted on their permit. Campgrounds are located at two to five mile intervals along the trail. Each campground has a specific capacity; individual campsites within each backcountry campground are identified by a numbered post.</p> <p>There are individual campsites and group campsites. Individual campsites are available for groups of 1-6 people (2 tents or hammocks maximum). Groups of 7-20 people (10 tents or hammocks maximum) must camp in designated group sites. <strong>Maximum three consecutive day stay at any backcountry campground.</strong> No persons or groups are permitted to camp longer than 14 days per calendar year in the lakeshore.<br /> <br /> Hammocks are allowed in place of a tent, but both tents and hammocks must stay within 15 feet of the numbered post at the campsite. Keep in mind that trees are not available at all sites. Beach camping is prohibited.<br /> <br /> <strong>No pets allowed.</strong> No bikes or wheeled or motorized vehicles allowed on trails. <br /> <br /> For more information about backcountry camping and how to make a reservation, go to the park's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/backcountry.htm\">Backcountry Camping planning page</a>.</p>",

This high-elevation lake (5,850 feet) offers spectacular views of the towering Lassen Peak and Chaos Crags volcanoes. <br /> <br /> More than 300 years ago, a rock avalanche from Chaos Crags dammed Manzanita Creek creating this shallow lake. With a deepest point of only 30 feet, trout often cruise the lake's large, shallow flats in search of food. Due to the large number of visitors to the lake, the fish are not easily spooked by humans.</p> <h4><strong>Regulations</strong></h4> <p>To ensure the availabilty of fish for all visitors, <strong>fishing in this lake is limited to catch and release with a single, barbless hook</strong>. Only lures and flies are permitted; no living or non-living bait may be used. The lake is not stocked, however fish stocking did occur prior to the park's establishment in 1916. A California State fishing license is requred. Please review all <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lavo/learn/management/fishing_regulations.htm\">fishing regulations</a> prior to fishing in the park.</p> <h4><b>Boating</b></h4> <p>Kayaks, canoes, waders, and float tubes are commonly used. Only non-motorized boats are permitted (boats may not carry or use a motor). All watercraft must be launched from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/ml-day-use-area.htm\">boat launch</a> to prevent damage to the shoreline wetlands. </p> <h4>Rod and Reel</h4> <p>For fishing with a rod and reel it is recommended that clear six-pound test line or smaller be used. At times the lake is crystal clear, and fish can see heavier line. A light spinning reel and nimble rod are a good choice for casting long distances and a sporting fight.</p> <h4>Fly Fishing</h4> <p>Manzanita Lake is nationally known for its fly-fishing opportunities. For fly fishing, a six-weight rod is recommended with a length of 9 to 10.5 feet with a #5 or #6 leader. Due to the abundance of willows around the lake, fly fishing can be challanging. Waders are advised. Most flies will work, however a few popular flies that work throughout the park are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Callibaetis (#16-18)                  </p> </li> <li> <p>Damsel Nymph (#14)</p> </li> <li> <p>Parachute Adams (#14-20)</p> </li> <li> <p>Traditional Adams (#16-20)</p> </li> <li> <p>Callibaetis Cripple (#14-16)</p> </li> <li> <p>Carpenter Ant (#14-16)</p> </li> <li> <p>Bouface brown (#10)</p> </li> <li> <p>Monroe leech, olive (#10)</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong> Manzanita Lake Specific Flies:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Midge Patterns</p> </li> <li> <p>Pupa Patterns,</p> </li> <li> <p>Callibraetis Nymphs</p> </li> <li> <p>Damselfly Nymphs</p> </li> <li> <p>Stripping Nymphs,</p> </li> <li> <p>Leech Patterns </p> </li> <li> <p>Wooly Buggers</p> </li> </ul>",

            "locationDescription": "The trail starts at the Pine Springs Trailhead (1/2 mile from the Pine Springs Visitor Center – check in at the visitor center, then turn right out of the visitor center parking lot). Follow the signs for the Guadalupe Peak Trail. Follow the hiker trail; the horse trail will add about 1 extra mile to the trip (although it is less steep).<br /> <br /> You will encounter the steepest part of the hike in the first mile and a half, as the trail switchbacks up the first steep slope. Be sure not to cut across the switchbacks, as this causes accelerated erosion. The views will get better with every switchback you climb.<br /> <br /> After about a mile and a half, the trail will become less steep as it passes a cliff and then turns around to the north-facing slope. Here, hikers will discover a small forest of pinion pine, south-western white pine, and Douglas fir. The forest exists here since on a north-facing slope there is not as much sunlight. The slightly cooler, shadier climate allows these pines to survive.<br /> <br /> After nearly three miles the trail will top out at a false summit. It is still a little more than a mile to the actual summit. The trail will flatten out for a short distance as it passes through a sparse forest of ponderosa pine. The backcountry campsite for overnight backpackers is on this summit (backcountry permit required to camp).<br /> <br /> After passing the backcountry campsite, the trail descends slightly and crosses a wooden bridge. After the bridge, the trail begins the final climb to the summit. After only a few switchbacks, the top of El Capitan will dominate the view to the south. Eventually you will pass the horse hitching posts and arrive at the summit, where on a clear day you will be rewarded with a tremendous view of the surrounding mountains and desert. ",

Guadalupe Peak is a rewarding, although very strenuous, 8.4 mile round trip hike with a 3,000 foot elevation gain. It will take from six to eight hours to complete the hike.<br /> <br /> The peak provides fantastic views from the highest point in the state of Texas (8,751 feet / 2,667 meters). It also introduces hikers to several of the park’s ecosystems including the high desert and the high elevation forests. On a clear day you will be rewarded with a tremendous view of the surrounding mountains and desert. Stop for a while and enjoy the view before beginning the hike back down.</p> <h4>Be Prepared:</h4> <ul> <li>Make sure you are prepared for the hike with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/gumo_11essentials.htm\">Eleven Essential items</a>. Carrying the Ten Essentials (plus one) with you can help you be prepared for minor injuries, sudden weather changes, or unexpected delays.</li> <li>This is a strenuous hike which begins at a mile above sea level and gains 3,000 feet. Do you have a medical conditions that could be worsened by certain activities or changes in altitude (asthma, heart condition)?</li> <li>While the stock trail adds a mile to the hike each direction, it is significantly less steep than the main trail, and may be useful if backpacking. </li> <li>When you consume half of the water you are carrying, turn around. </li> <li>The descent is often more difficult than the climb to the peak due to the rocky trail surface and fatigue. Hiking poles help!</li> <li>The top of Texas is not a toilet. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/gumo_human_waste_wilderness.htm\">Make sure to bring a commercial toilet bag system with you</a> to protect the environment you are hiking in. Pack out all of your trash. </li> <li>Layers and sunscreen are important to protect you from the elements.</li> <li>At the top of the peak expect temperatures at least ten degrees cooler and wind speeds at least ten miles per hour faster than Pine Springs. </li> <li>In areas more than a quarter of a mile from restroom facilities, and all areas inside the Wilderness boundary,<strong> all solid human waste, feminine hygiene products, and toilet paper must be carried out in a landfill-safe commercial toilet bag</strong>.</li> <li>Much of the trail is over steep, rocky terrain. <strong><em>Hikers should wear comfortable hiking boots with good traction</em></strong>, and that are well broken in.

Winds in excess of 80 miles per hour are not uncommon. Check at the visitor center for the current forecast.</li> <li>There is little shade along the trail. Summer temperatures can be quite hot. <em><strong>Bring plenty of water, at least one gallon per person, per day. Also come prepared with sunscreen, a hat, and protective clothing.</strong></em></li> <li><strong><em>The 8.4 mile hike to the summit and back takes the average hiker from six to eight hours round trip</em></strong>. Plan to start the hike early in the morning, especially in the summer when high temperatures and afternoon thunderstorms are a concern.</li> <li>Bring enough warm clothing. Even in the hottest weather, thunderstorms can cause the temperature to drop significantly.</li> <li>If you intend to make the peak for sunrise or sunset, make sure you have a light source, either a head lamp or a flashlight.</li> </ul>",

The Grandview Rim Trail at the Grandview location is super easy to find and to follow. Park in the area near the Grandview Visitor Center and start your warm-up by walking the short distance to the Main Overlook. This is about a football field distance from the car parking area. As you walk to the Main Overlook from the parking area, notice the benches to your left that are bordering a wide trail. This is your starting point. The Grandview Rim Trail follows along the perimeter of the Gorge so keep the Gorge to your right shoulder and you will come to a sign for the North Overlook. This is where you will split away from the Gorge and start in a more forested area. When you reach the road , stay on the trail to the right and it is a windy trail that will have a change in elevation of about 460 feet. The trail will end in a parking lot for Turkey Spur. If you want to stop running for a few minutes and go up the 150 steps in this rock outcropping next to the parking lot you can. There are three additional vantage points to see down into the Gorge from the top of Turkey Spur. Most runners simply turn around in the parking lot and retrace their steps back to the main parking area next to the Main Overlook. ",
