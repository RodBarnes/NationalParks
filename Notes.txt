If user taps "Get Data" button, should this always start over from 0 so that, in case the data has been updated, it is reflected?
Or, does that only happen with a pull down?
It should probably get the first set of data automatically upon display rather than even having a "Get Data" button.

TODO
----
?Do I need to add getting the list of Topics and Activites since these are referenced in the parks JSON.  The parks include all the data for its own Topics and Activities so these would only be needed as the universe of each in order to select from to trim the list of parks in a query.

There should be a [Search] that brings up a page that allows selecting multiple Topics, Activities, States -- what else?  Maybe partial name match?  This would then result in a list of Parks that match the query.  While in effect, the [Search] button becomes [Clear] (or maybe [All]?).

The [Closest Park] button should go to the detail page for that park, not just show a message with the name.

What about allowing a setting that determines a max distance and finding all Parks within that radius?
