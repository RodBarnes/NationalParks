Fleshing out PlaceDetail items.

All current Place records have 1 or less images.  So, an ImageList doesn't make sense. But, without one, if it shows only that single image, it still needs to allows for more than one and any use of an image has to always take the first of the array.

Next, work on Tour and Event pages.

Somewhere, I lost the "data_loading_image". It is no longer displaying when a list is empty.


API Issues
----------
It appears that the 'q' parameter is a full-text search for any listed value.  It seems to accept multiple specified values -- space-delimited, maybe comma-delimited.

Event API returns everything -- it does not recognize start or limit.  It does have a pageSize and pageNumber.  Maybe those can be used?

Places is not returned in any (recgonizable) sorted order and doesn't provide a "sort" parameter


Todo & Ideas
------------
If filter is applied, need to visually indicated that (in the header?) when that is in effect. Is this an icon?  A label?

Need to review all need for try/catch, catching and dislaying errors.

Probably need to be able to move to ParkDetail from CampgroundDetail, TourDetail, and EventDetail as was done for PlaceDetail?
	- Tour has RelatedPark (like Place) so that could be done the same way.
	- Event has only ParkFullName so that could be really difficult.  The fullname could be displayed (too bad it isn't the short name) but an that be used to get the Park?

Image list should support tapping on an image to see it fullscreen or something.  Do we support showing the crops?  Maybe just listing them and supporting download?

Maybe totalItems should be an observable property and have the title in the page be like "Name ({TotalItems})" so that it just gets updated each time the totalItems changes -- which should only happen after each GetItemsAsync().

After recopgnizing that Filter isn't a model but a VM, can I use it as an additional base when creating the others (e.g., ParkFitlerVM) and just reference the base members directly of via the member this.FilterVM?  The issue is that the current mechanism relies upon the filter contents being avilable to the ListVM and applying its Selected contents when getting the data.

Are ThingsToDo just a combination of all the others?
Do I need an icon for ThingsToDo.

Settings?
	- User determined states by which to always filter?
	- Which list to display as the default page?

Need a quick search (alphabet thumb?) or some other means of quickly locating a specific Park or Campground.  I could add a search button for now...  Or maybe a search at the top of the list that limits the list as values are entered?  Maybe could use the UserStoppedTypingBehavior from the Maui.Toolkit?

Can I turn the CollapsibleView into a UserControl?

EllipsisLabel control to display an elipsis at the end of too-long-to-display text?  I think this page might have some related guidance: https://swharden.com/blog/2021-10-16-maui-graphics-measurestring/

Need to find phone in midst of text and turn into link to call.  This may be as simple as turning it into HTML text and selecting that as the text type in the label.

Determine how to get an image of the webcam and display that in the webcam list.

Does it make sense to have the Webcams as a separate aspect/list?  Or should the webcams be just part of the ParkDetail?  Or maybe both?

Webcams are not sorted alphbetically by title; unsure what the order is.  And it does not have the 'sort' parameter as found on Parks.

Maybe WebcamImageList doesn't make since.  Most don't have images.  These (there may be others) each have one image:
	Clarno Unit: The Palisades
	Live View From Panther Junction
	Spruce Tree House
	Pine Springs Canyon View
	Dell City View
	El Capitan View
	Bartlett Cove Lagoon and Fairweather Range
	Bartlett Cove Public Dock

Change the splash icon to the AdvApp icon.

Add a tap gesture on the AdvApp section of the About page to go to the AdvApp site?

The parks and campgrounds come in sorted order.  Webcams are not -- at least, no order is determined.

Allow setting radious in miles and presenting list of Parks within that radius.

The NPS API provides for "Parks with Activity", "Parks for Topic", "Parks with Amenity", etc. but not combinations.  The "Parks" supports a query "q" but isn't clear what is the format.

Can I do a swipe gesture to go to a new page?  Thinking of making Hours and Images part of a swipe set of Park like we did with FE Connect.  But in the FE Connect case, they were truly extensions of the same object to collect additional data.

Maybe need a string handler that recognizes URLs in text (e.g., weather descriptions) and turns those into clickable links.

Still unsure what to do with the ExceptionHours and whether to display the StandardHours since they are often (alway?) included as text in the description.

WebCam image model is the same as Park image model but they include two additional properties: Description (which I've never seen filled), and a collection of "crops" which indicate an aspect ratio and the associated URL to view it. For now, I've derived WebCamImage from Image.  But should Image be ParkImage (which would eliminate the ambiguity with System...Image)?

And maybe Activity should be ParkActivity to eliminate the ambiguity with System...Activity?

What about Amenities, Events, Park Places?  Are there others?  Are these just additional pages in the swipe-set planned for the Hours and Images?

What is the best way to handle the string Lat/Long?  Ideally, they'd be private and only expose the double values?
