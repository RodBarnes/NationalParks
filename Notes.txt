Park list and Campground list are working including Filter by state.  Waiting on response to issue https://github.com/nationalparkservice/nps-api-samples/issues/3 regarding use of 'q' parameter.  It appears that the 'q' parameter in the API query can accept multiple entries separated with an '&' (x26) or ',' (x2D); e.g., activity%3DBiking%26topic%3DAfrican%20American%20Heritage.  These are used in an 'OR' condition not 'AND'; i.e., those with the activity 'Biking' OR the topic 'African American Heritage'  But the 'q' parameter also gives unexpected results; e.g., a search for Parks with Activity="Dog Sledding" returns 36 parks but only 4 of them actually have that in the "activities" list.  I submitted an issue on this.  Until that is resolved, I'm not sure how to use this reliably.


Todo & Ideas
------------
Maybe some of the filter-related actions should be in the Filter class?

In Park, can I make the Topics, Activities, and States public ObervableCollections so they're accessible directly from within FilterPage?  This would elminate the need to copy all of these into a new ObservableCollection in Filter.

EllipsisLabel control to display an elipsis at the end of too-long-to-display text?  I think this page might have some related guidance: https://swharden.com/blog/2021-10-16-maui-graphics-measurestring/

Need a quick search (alphbet thumb) or some other means of quickly locating a specific Park or Campground.  I could add a search button for now...

Need to find phone in midst of text and turn into link to call.

Determine how to get an image of the webcam and display that in the webcam list.

Does it make sense to have the Webcams as a separate aspect/list?  Or should the webcams be just part of the ParkDetail?  Or maybe both?

Webcams are not sorted alphbetically by title; unsure what the order is.  And it does not have the 'sort' parameter as found on Parks.

Maybe WebcamImageList doesn't make since.  Most don't have images.  These (there may be others) each have one image:
	Clarno Unit: The Palisades
	Live View From Panther Junction
	Spruce Tree House
	Pine Springs Canyon View
	Dell City View
	El Capitan View
	Bartlett Cove Lagoon and Fairweather Range
	Bartlett Cove Public Dock

Change the splash icon to the AdvApp icon.

Add a tap gesture on the AdvApp section of the About page to go to the AdvApp site?

The parks and campgrounds come in sorted order.  Webcams are not -- at least, no order is determined.

Allow setting radious in miles and presenting list of Parks within that radius.

The NPS API provides for "Parks with Activity", "Parks for Topic", "Parks with Amenity", etc. but not combinations.  The "Parks" supports a query "q" but isn't clear what is the format.

Can I do a swipe gesture to go to a new page?  Thinking of making Hours and Images part of a swipe set of Park like we did with FE Connect.  But in the FE Connect case, they were truly extensions of the same object to collect additional data.

Maybe need a string handler that recognizes URLs in text (e.g., weather descriptions) and turns those into clickable links.

Still unsure what to do with the ExceptionHours and whether to display the StandardHours since they are often (alway?) included as text in the description.

WebCam image model is the same as Park image model but they include two additional properties: Description (which I've never seen filled), and a collection of "crops" which indicate an aspect ratio and the associated URL to view it. For now, I've derived WebCamImage from Image.  But should Image be ParkImage (which would eliminate the ambiguity with System...Image)?

And maybe Activity should be ParkActivity to eliminate the ambiguity with System...Activity?

What about Amenities, Events, Park Places?  Are there others?  Are these just additional pages in the swipe-set planned for the Hours and Images?

What is the best way to handle the string Lat/Long?  Ideally, they'd be private and only expose the double values?
