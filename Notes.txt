Working to figure out cause of "Specified cast is no valid" error.
	- It seems to happen only while deserializing and only after a number of API calls have been made.
	- I can run DataTester through each of the 12 (except Events which is hobbled at 10/request) x6 without ever encountering the error.
	- Try running pages with Filter stuff commented out.
	- Differences between using DataTester and the 12 separate pages:
		+ DataTester is a single VM that inherits from ListVM.  Does having ListVM as a base class present some common thing that spills over?  It shouldn't, right?  A base class is not shared; it is just a common structure that is shared but the instances are different of the base class is different for each subclass.
	- Can I release just all those that have their own location?
		+ This seems to be working pretty well but I encountered a Null in Articles.  I had gone through doing [Closest] twice on everything and then went in to playing with Filter on each of them.  After clearing filter on Article, did [Closest] and result was null about halfway through the list.  See notes at top...

Working to split out ListVM GetItems().  The base class should not know about details of a subclass.  But if I move GetItems to the ParkListVM subclass, it cannot be seen by ListView.
	- Fundamental issues:
		- Desire to use a single view referenced in each page and not duplicate that XAML code.  This requires that the single view be able to do GetItems() for the Collection but it cannot know what type is being displayed in the list.
		- Desire to use a single base VM referenced by each page VM and not duplicate C# code.  But the page VM is the only one that knows the actual result/model class.  The base VM 
	- Try composition where ListVM is some class to which each current subclass (e.g, ParkListVM) has a reference.
	+ This would provide the same code-reuse capability but let the page VM do all the work instead of handing off to a base VM.
	+ But ListView would still not work because it 

Need to prepare for release
	- Help page?  Would this be the start page?
	- Validate all page displays

Possible text for help page:
	- This app relies upon data supplied by the National Park Service API which is publically available.  It provides information on Parks, Campgrounds, and other facilities, as well as news releases, articles, and multimedia produced by the National Park Service about the events and activities available at various national parks.


Issues & Ideas
--------------

Try using HttpClient.BaseAddress = DomainUrl;

Probably should only get the location when it is needed; i.e., using [Closest] or [Location].

For now, commenting out access to NewsRelease because it does not the images in Release version.
	- All ListPages display using ListView and ListVM.
	- No difference in code values between Release and Debug. :-(
	- Article (which works) and NewsRelease use essentially identical code to populate MainImage.
	- Confirmed (by replacing Title with MainImage.Id) that all items are getting a MainImage.
	- So why don't they display under release?

Without <RefreshView> the <CollectionView.EmptyView> does not display

Can I manually remove maccatalyst from the csproj file?

Entry.ClearButtonVisibility is not working.  Opened issue https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/13659

Maybe add an additional property (e.g., TileDescription?) to BaseModel specifically for display in the list tile.  For Park, this would be populated by Designation so that could be used in the tile.  For the others, it might only be a duplicate of Description.

Is it possible to consolidate all the *FilterPages into a single FilterPage?  The only hang-up would seem to be the need to specify which filters to display based upon the list.  But if this just ends up being State, then they could be.  Or, maybe state is always enabled as part of ListVM?  Then the only special one would be those that enable others; e.g., ParkList.

Determine how to get a snapshot of the webcam and display that in the webcam list as the image.  Would this help: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15702031/get-thumbnail-image-of-video-file-in-c-sharp

I could add a list of "Related Campgrounds" to Park -- but this would mean getting them as I do with Alerts.  Maybe... What about the ability to go back and forth between things -- Park to Campground to Place to Park.  What does this do to the routing?

Splitting the retrieval of Tour and Place location to another time instead of getting it regardless while populating the list might be helpful.  Location is only needed when either:
	- Tapping [Location] from the detail page -- so it could just be retrieved there if it is missing.
	- Tapping [Closest] from the list page -- so it could just be retrieved there if it is missing.  But this also means getting it not just for those yet to be retrieved but those already in the list.  I tried implenting this and it makes GetClosest for Tours very, very slow.  Whereas, the orignal way (that gets the location when loading the items) takes a little hit per item but really not that much.  Overall, the original seems faster.

Settings?
	- User determined states by which to always filter?
	- Which list to display as the default page?  Probably would use the CurrentItem property of <Shell>? And update the name of the new item based to that name based upon user selection?

EllipsisLabel control to display an elipsis at the end of too-long-to-display text?  I think this page might have some related guidance: https://swharden.com/blog/2021-10-16-maui-graphics-measurestring/

Need to find phone in midst of text and turn into link to call.  This may be as simple as turning it into HTML text and selecting that as the text type in the label.

Does it make sense to have the Webcams as a separate aspect/list?  Or should the webcams be just part of the ParkDetail?  Or maybe both?

Add a tap gesture on the AdvApp section of the About page to go to the AdvApp site?

Allow setting radious in miles and presenting list of Parks within that radius.

Maybe need a string handler that recognizes URLs in text (e.g., weather descriptions) and turns those into clickable links.

Still unsure what to do with the ExceptionHours and whether to display the StandardHours since they are often (alway?) included as text in the description.

And maybe Activity should be NpsActivity to eliminate the ambiguity with System...Activity?


Failed Ideas
------------
Can I change Related Parks so that it shows an element like Campground when there is a single one and a CollapsibleView when there is more than one.  In fact, are there any that have more than one?
	- This isn't worth it.  There are enough Places and ThingsToDo that have multiple parks that leaving it multiple makes sense for consistency.

Can the x:DataType of the DetailPages be set to just DetailVM?
	- No, because DetailVM does not have a reference to the model that is required by several of the elements.

Can I do the same with the Detail Buttons as I did with the Avatar image; i.e., move them into DetailButtonVM?  But that would also include moving the OpenMap and Images RelayCommands into the DetailButtonVM.
	- No, I attempted this but the buttons didn't recognize the tap.
