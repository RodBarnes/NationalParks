If user taps "Get Data" button, should this always start over from 0 so that, in case the data has been updated, it is reflected?
Or, does that only happen with a pull down?
It should probably get the first set of data automatically upon display rather than even having a "Get Data" button.

TODO
----
The [Closest Park] button should go to the detail page for that park, not just show a message with the name.

What about allowing a setting that determines a max distance and finding all Parks within that radius?
