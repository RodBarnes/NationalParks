If a filter selection is made and it is lower down in the list it isn't visible when returning to edit the filter.  Should it automatically scroll to the top selected position?  Or...?

I attempted to turn CollapsibleView into a user Control but failed because I couldn't figure out how to inject the created VM into the page.  The *DetailVM creates each CollapsibleViewVM it needs and this needs to then be associated with the respective user control (CollapsivleView) instance.  Couldn't get there.  Maybe later.

Review the whole IsPopulated mechanism and need.  Maybe this isn't needed?  Maybe it should be done differently?

Event has SiteCode rather than ParkCode.  It appears to be the same so could be used to go to related park?  It also has ParkFullname so maybe that could be used?

Event API uses pageSize (which defaults to 10 and corresponds to limit) and pageNumber (which defaults to 1 and corresponds to start).  But I tried running through tester getting 20 pages at a time and it gets through the first 40 and then poops coming back with a null? Data.

Settings?
	- User determined states by which to always filter?
	- Which list to display as the default page?  Probably would use the CurrentItem property of <Shell>? And update the name of the new item based to that name based upon user selection?

Need a quick search (alphabet thumb?) or some other means of quickly locating a specific Park or Campground.  I could add a search button for now...  Or maybe a search at the top of the list that limits the list as values are entered?  Maybe could use the UserStoppedTypingBehavior from the Maui.Toolkit?

EllipsisLabel control to display an elipsis at the end of too-long-to-display text?  I think this page might have some related guidance: https://swharden.com/blog/2021-10-16-maui-graphics-measurestring/

Need to find phone in midst of text and turn into link to call.  This may be as simple as turning it into HTML text and selecting that as the text type in the label.

Determine how to get an image of the webcam and display that in the webcam list.

Does it make sense to have the Webcams as a separate aspect/list?  Or should the webcams be just part of the ParkDetail?  Or maybe both?

Webcams are not sorted alphbetically by title; unsure what the order is.  And it does not have the 'sort' parameter as found on Parks.

Maybe WebcamImageList doesn't make since.  Most don't have images.  These (there may be others) each have one image:
	Clarno Unit: The Palisades
	Live View From Panther Junction
	Spruce Tree House
	Pine Springs Canyon View
	Dell City View
	El Capitan View
	Bartlett Cove Lagoon and Fairweather Range
	Bartlett Cove Public Dock

Change the splash icon to the AdvApp icon.

Add a tap gesture on the AdvApp section of the About page to go to the AdvApp site?

The parks and campgrounds come in sorted order.  Webcams are not -- at least, no order is determined.

Allow setting radious in miles and presenting list of Parks within that radius.

The NPS API provides for "Parks with Activity", "Parks for Topic", "Parks with Amenity", etc. but not combinations.  The "Parks" supports a query "q" but isn't clear what is the format.

Maybe need a string handler that recognizes URLs in text (e.g., weather descriptions) and turns those into clickable links.

Still unsure what to do with the ExceptionHours and whether to display the StandardHours since they are often (alway?) included as text in the description.

WebCam image model is the same as Park image model but they include two additional properties: Description (which I've never seen filled), and a collection of "crops" which indicate an aspect ratio and the associated URL to view it. For now, I've derived WebCamImage from Image.  But should Image be ParkImage (which would eliminate the ambiguity with System...Image)?

And maybe Activity should be NpsActivity to eliminate the ambiguity with System...Activity?

What about Amenities, Events, Park Places?  Are there others?  Are these just additional pages in the swipe-set planned for the Hours and Images?
