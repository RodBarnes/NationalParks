Allow setting radious in miles and presenting list of Parks within that radius.

The API provides for "Parks with Activity", "Parks for Topic", "Parks with Amenity", etc. but not combinations.  The "Parks" supports a query "q" but isn't clear what is the format.

Can I do a swipe gesture to go to a new page?  Thinking of making Hours and Images part of a swipe set of Park like we did with FE Connect.  But in the FE Connect case, they were truly extensions of the same object to collect additional data.
