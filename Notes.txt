If user taps "Get Data" button, should this always start over from 0 so that, in case the data has been updated, it is reflected?
Or, does that only happen with a pull down?
It should probably get the first set of data automatically upon display rather than even having a "Get Data" button.

TODO

Need to add getting the list of Topics and Activites since these are referenced in the parks JSON.
Need to find schema for Fee and EntrancePass.  Look in Park or...?
