If a filter selection is made and it is lower down in the list it isn't visible when returning to edit the filter.  Should it automatically scroll to the top selected position?  Or...?

I attempted to turn CollapsibleView into a user Control but failed because I couldn't figure out how to inject the created VM into the page.  The *DetailVM creates each CollapsibleViewVM it needs and this needs to then be associated with the respective user control (CollapsivleView) instance.  Couldn't get there.  Maybe later.

Review the whole IsPopulated mechanism and need.  Maybe this isn't needed?  Maybe it should be done differently?

Event API uses pageSize (which defaults to 10 and corresponds to limit) and pageNumber (which defaults to 1 and corresponds to start).  But I tried running through tester getting 20 pages at a time and it gets through the first 40 and then poops coming back with a null? Data.

Settings?
	- User determined states by which to always filter?
	- Which list to display as the default page?  Probably would use the CurrentItem property of <Shell>? And update the name of the new item based to that name based upon user selection?

Need a quick search (alphabet thumb?) or some other means of quickly locating a specific Park or Campground.  I could add a search button for now...  Or maybe a search at the top of the list that limits the list as values are entered?  Maybe could use the UserStoppedTypingBehavior from the Maui.Toolkit?

EllipsisLabel control to display an elipsis at the end of too-long-to-display text?  I think this page might have some related guidance: https://swharden.com/blog/2021-10-16-maui-graphics-measurestring/

Need to find phone in midst of text and turn into link to call.  This may be as simple as turning it into HTML text and selecting that as the text type in the label.

Determine how to get an image of the webcam and display that in the webcam list.

Does it make sense to have the Webcams as a separate aspect/list?  Or should the webcams be just part of the ParkDetail?  Or maybe both?

Change the splash icon to the AdvApp icon.

Add a tap gesture on the AdvApp section of the About page to go to the AdvApp site?

Allow setting radious in miles and presenting list of Parks within that radius.

The NPS API provides for "Parks with Activity", "Parks for Topic", "Parks with Amenity", etc. but not combinations.  The "Parks" supports a query "q" but isn't clear what is the format.

Maybe need a string handler that recognizes URLs in text (e.g., weather descriptions) and turns those into clickable links.

Still unsure what to do with the ExceptionHours and whether to display the StandardHours since they are often (alway?) included as text in the description.

And maybe Activity should be NpsActivity to eliminate the ambiguity with System...Activity?

What about Amenities, Events, Park Places?  Are there others?  Are these just additional pages in the swipe-set planned for the Hours and Images?
