Determine how to get an image of the webcam and display that in the webcam list.
What is the webcam image list going to do since most (all?) don't have any images.

Change the splash icon to the AdvApp icon.

Add a tap gesture on the AdvApp section of the About page to go to the AdvApp site?

Allow setting radious in miles and presenting list of Parks within that radius.

The NPS API provides for "Parks with Activity", "Parks for Topic", "Parks with Amenity", etc. but not combinations.  The "Parks" supports a query "q" but isn't clear what is the format.

Can I do a swipe gesture to go to a new page?  Thinking of making Hours and Images part of a swipe set of Park like we did with FE Connect.  But in the FE Connect case, they were truly extensions of the same object to collect additional data.

Maybe need a string handler that recognizes URLs in text (e.g., weather descriptions) and turns those into clickable links.

Still unsure what to do with the ExceptionHours and whether to display the StandardHours since they are often (alway?) included as text in the description.

WebCam image model is the same as Park image model but they include two additional properties: Description (which I've never seen filled), and a collection of "crops" which indicate an aspect ratio and the associated URL to view it. For now, I've derived WebCamImage from Image.  But should Image be ParkImage (which would eliminate the ambiguity with System...Image)?

And maybe Activity should be ParkActivity to eliminate the ambiguity with System...Activity?

What about Amenities, Events, Park Places?  Are there others?  Are these just additional pages in the swipe-set planned for the Hours and Images?

What is the best way to handle the string Lat/Long?  Ideally, they'd be private and only expose the double values?
