Event
-----
Event API returns everything -- it does not recognize start or limit.  It does have a pageSize and pageNumber.  Maybe those can be used?

Event API seems broken.  Anything from 61 and beyond returns no data -- here is the result:
	{
		"total": "0",
		"errors": [],
		"data": [],
		"dates": [],
		"pagenumber": "61",
		"pagesize": "10"
	}

The count of returns pages is 10 for everything up to and including a pageNumber of 59.  At pageNumber 60, it returns only 6 pages.  At pageNumber 61 and beyond, it returns 0 pages.


Places
------
Places is not returned in any (recgonizable) sorted order and doesn't provide a "sort" parameter
