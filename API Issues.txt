Event
-----
Event API returns everything -- it does not recognize start or limit.  It does have a pageSize and pageNumber.  Maybe those can be used?

Event API seems broken.  Anything from 61 and beyond returns no data -- here is the result:
	{
		"total": "0",
		"errors": [],
		"data": [],
		"dates": [],
		"pagenumber": "61",
		"pagesize": "10"
	}

Event has SiteCode rather than ParkCode.  It appears to be the same so could be used to go to related park?  It also has ParkFullname so maybe that could be used?

The count of returns pages is 10 for everything up to and including a pageNumber of 59.  At pageNumber 60, it returns only 6 pages.  At pageNumber 61 and beyond, it returns 0 pages.


Webcam
------
Webcams are not sorted alphbetically by title; unsure what the order is.  And it does not have the 'sort' parameter as found on Parks.

Maybe WebcamImageList doesn't make since.  Most don't have images.  These (there may be others) each have one image:
	Clarno Unit: The Palisades
	Live View From Panther Junction
	Spruce Tree House
	Pine Springs Canyon View
	Dell City View
	El Capitan View
	Bartlett Cove Lagoon and Fairweather Range
	Bartlett Cove Public Dock

WebCam image model is the same as Park image model but they include two additional properties: Description (which I've never seen filled), and a collection of "crops" which indicate an aspect ratio and the associated URL to view it. For now, I've derived WebCamImage from Image.  But should Image be ParkImage (which would eliminate the ambiguity with System...Image)?


Places
------
Places is not returned in any (recgonizable) sorted order and doesn't provide a "sort" parameter
